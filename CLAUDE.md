## Memories

### Development Workflow
- Always keep notes of work in ai-dev-notes folder and create a folder title with epic-story-team type naming structure and with error, feature, test md. Also can just view ai development notes structure setting in ai-development-direction
- use dev branch as main branch to branch from
- Always try to add a file or files that test whatever you are doing as to allow me to test it outside of our thread. This goes for all work accomplished where it makes sense of course. 

### Documentation and Tracking
- Always document what we worked on and what we think we should work on next
- Maintain an "update todos" list with completed items and next steps
- Refer back to this documentation in subsequent work sessions to provide continuity and context
