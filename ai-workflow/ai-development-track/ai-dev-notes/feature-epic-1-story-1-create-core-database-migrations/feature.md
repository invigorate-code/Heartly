# Feature: Create Core Database Migrations
**Epic**: Epic 1 - The Foundation Crisis  
**Story**: Story 1.1 - Create Core Database Migrations  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Started**: [Date]  
**Completed**: [Date]  

## üéØ Implementation Plan
Create comprehensive database migrations for all core entities (User, Client, Facility, Tenant, UserActionAuditLog) with proper relationships, constraints, and tenant isolation.

## üîß Technical Approach
- Use TypeORM migration system for version-controlled schema changes
- Implement proper foreign key constraints with appropriate cascade rules
- Add performance indexes for common query patterns
- Ensure tenant isolation through proper schema design
- Include audit logging capabilities in the base schema

## üìã Implementation Steps
1. **Create User Entity Migration**
   - Add all required fields with proper types and constraints
   - Include tenant_id for multi-tenant isolation
   - Add email uniqueness constraint (per tenant)
   - Include created_at, updated_at timestamps

2. **Create Client Entity Migration**
   - Add relationship to User and Facility entities
   - Include tenant_id and facility_id for proper isolation
   - Add status field with proper constraints
   - Include PHI fields with encryption considerations

3. **Create Facility Entity Migration**
   - Add tenant relationship and isolation fields
   - Include facility-specific configuration fields
   - Add proper constraints for facility naming

4. **Create Tenant Entity Migration**
   - Add tenant configuration and settings fields
   - Include tenant-specific customization options
   - Add proper constraints for tenant identification

5. **Create UserActionAuditLog Entity Migration**
   - Add comprehensive audit logging structure
   - Include user_id, action_type, table_name, record_id fields
   - Add old_values and new_values JSONB fields
   - Include proper indexing for audit queries

6. **Add Performance Indexes**
   - Composite indexes for tenant-scoped queries
   - Indexes for common lookup patterns
   - Partial indexes for active records only

7. **Implement Database Constraints**
   - NOT NULL constraints for required fields
   - CHECK constraints for data validation
   - UNIQUE constraints where appropriate
   - Foreign key constraints with proper cascade rules

## üß™ Testing Strategy
- **Migration Testing**: Test all migrations can be run up and down
- **Constraint Testing**: Verify all constraints work correctly
- **Performance Testing**: Measure query performance with indexes
- **Isolation Testing**: Verify tenant isolation works properly
- **Audit Testing**: Verify audit logging captures all changes

## üîç Code Review Notes
- Ensure all migrations are reversible
- Verify tenant isolation is properly implemented
- Check that PHI fields are properly secured
- Confirm audit logging captures all necessary data
- Validate performance impact of indexes

## üõ°Ô∏è HIPAA Compliance Considerations
- All PHI fields must be encrypted at rest
- Audit logging must capture all PHI access
- Tenant isolation must prevent cross-tenant data access
- Database constraints must prevent unauthorized data entry
- Proper access controls must be implemented at database level

## üìä Success Criteria
- [ ] All core entities have proper migrations
- [ ] Migrations can be run in sequence without conflicts
- [ ] All foreign key relationships are properly established
- [ ] Performance indexes are in place for common queries
- [ ] Database constraints ensure data integrity
- [ ] Tenant isolation is properly implemented
- [ ] Audit logging structure is in place
- [ ] All migrations are reversible
- [ ] HIPAA compliance requirements are met
