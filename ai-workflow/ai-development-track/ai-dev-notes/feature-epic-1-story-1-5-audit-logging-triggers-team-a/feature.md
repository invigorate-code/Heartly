# Epic 1 Story 1.5: Create Audit Logging Tables and Triggers (Team A)

## Overview
This story implements comprehensive database-level audit logging for all data changes in the Heartly Healthcare Platform, ensuring HIPAA compliance and providing a complete audit trail for all operations.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Audit Log Table Structure
Created `data_audit_log` table with the following fields:
- **id**: Unique identifier for each audit record
- **table_name**: Name of the table being audited
- **operation**: Type of operation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- **row_id**: ID of the affected row
- **user_id**: User who performed the operation
- **tenant_id**: Tenant context for multi-tenancy
- **facility_id**: Facility context when applicable
- **timestamp**: When the operation occurred
- **old_values**: Previous values (JSONB format)
- **new_values**: New values (JSONB format)
- **changed_fields**: Array of fields that changed
- **session_id**: Session identifier for tracking
- **ip_address**: Client IP address
- **user_agent**: Client user agent

### 2. Audit Trigger Function
Created a universal trigger function that:
- Captures all INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations
- Extracts user context from PostgreSQL session variables
- Calculates changed fields for UPDATE operations
- Skips logging if no actual changes occurred
- Excludes system fields (createdAt, updatedAt) from tracking
- Handles facility_id extraction for facility-scoped entities

### 3. Database Triggers
Implemented triggers on all core tables:
- `user_audit_trigger`: Tracks user account changes
- `client_audit_trigger`: Tracks client data changes
- `facility_audit_trigger`: Tracks facility changes
- `tenant_audit_trigger`: Tracks tenant configuration changes
- `facility_staff_audit_trigger`: Tracks staff assignment changes

### 4. RLS Policy for Audit Logs
Implemented role-based access control for audit logs:
- **OWNER**: Can see all audit logs in their tenant
- **ADMIN**: Can see audit logs for their assigned facilities
- **STAFF**: Can only see their own audit logs

### 5. Utility Functions

#### Audit Log Retention
- `cleanup_old_audit_logs()`: Removes logs older than 2 years
- Ensures compliance with data retention policies

#### Audit Log Export
- `export_audit_logs()`: Exports audit logs for compliance reporting
- Parameters:
  - start_date: Beginning of date range
  - end_date: End of date range
  - tenant_id (optional): Filter by tenant
  - table_name (optional): Filter by table
- Returns formatted data with user emails and facility names

### 6. Performance Optimization
Created indexes for efficient querying:
- `idx_audit_log_table_row`: For entity-specific lookups
- `idx_audit_log_user_timestamp`: For user activity tracking
- `idx_audit_log_tenant_timestamp`: For tenant-wide reports
- `idx_audit_log_timestamp`: For time-based queries

## Security Considerations
1. **Tenant Isolation**: Audit logs respect tenant boundaries
2. **Role-Based Access**: Different visibility based on user role
3. **Immutability**: Audit logs cannot be modified after creation
4. **Context Tracking**: Captures full session context for forensics
5. **Sensitive Data**: System fields excluded from tracking

## Compliance Features
1. **HIPAA Compliance**: Complete audit trail for all PHI access
2. **Data Retention**: Automated cleanup after 2 years
3. **Export Capability**: Generate reports for auditors
4. **Change Tracking**: Detailed record of what changed
5. **User Attribution**: Every change linked to a user

## Integration Requirements
- RLS context middleware must set session variables
- Applications should set additional context (IP, user agent)
- Regular execution of cleanup function recommended
- Export function should be exposed via API for compliance

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test all CRUD operations generate audit logs
2. Verify RLS policies restrict access appropriately
3. Test export function with various parameters
4. Verify performance impact is acceptable
5. Test cleanup function removes old records

## Migration Notes
- Migration creates all components in a single transaction
- Rollback support included for all objects
- Uses JSONB for flexibility with schema changes
- Triggers use SECURITY DEFINER for consistent access
