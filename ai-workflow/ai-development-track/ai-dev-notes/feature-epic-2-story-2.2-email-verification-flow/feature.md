# Feature Implementation: Story 2.2 - Email Verification Flow

## Story Overview
**Track B Story 2.2**: Implement Email Verification Flow
**Epic**: Chapter 2 - Authentication System Overhaul
**Priority**: High (Critical for security and user onboarding)

## Requirements Analysis

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Email verification is required for new user accounts
- [ ] Verification email is sent with proper branding
- [ ] Email contains secure verification link
- [ ] Verification link expires after 24 hours
- [ ] User cannot access application until email is verified
- [ ] Resend verification email functionality works
- [ ] Email verification status is tracked in database
- [ ] Proper error messages for expired/invalid links
- [ ] Email templates are customizable

### Current State Analysis
From Story 1.4 completion merge with dev branch, Team A (Stories 1.5 & 2.1) has built extensive email verification infrastructure:

#### âœ… Already Implemented by Team A
- **SuperTokens Email Verification**: Fully configured with OPTIONAL mode
- **Email Verification Endpoints**: `/verify-email` and `/resendVerificationEmail` in auth controller
- **Frontend Hooks**: Email verification state management and UI components
- **Session Management**: Enhanced session payload includes email verification status (`st-ev`)
- **Middleware Integration**: RLS context includes session audit data
- **Manual Verification Checks**: Auth controller checks email verification for protected operations

#### ðŸ”„ Story 2.2 Primary Tasks
Since Team A built 90% of the infrastructure, Story 2.2 primarily involves:
1. **Switch from OPTIONAL to REQUIRED mode**: Change SuperTokens configuration
2. **Configure email service**: Set up actual email delivery (AWS SES, SendGrid, etc.)
3. **Update auth flow**: Remove manual checks since REQUIRED mode handles enforcement
4. **Test end-to-end**: Verify complete email verification flow works

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: SuperTokens Configuration Update
- Change email verification from OPTIONAL to REQUIRED in SuperTokens config
- Update initialization to enforce email verification before access
- Remove manual email verification checks in auth controller

### Phase 2: Email Service Configuration
- Configure email service provider (AWS SES recommended for HIPAA compliance)
- Set up email templates with proper branding
- Configure email delivery settings and rate limiting

### Phase 3: Auth Flow Optimization
- Remove manual email verification checks in protected endpoints
- Update auth guards to rely on SuperTokens built-in verification
- Ensure proper error handling for unverified users

### Phase 4: Testing and Documentation
- Test complete email verification flow end-to-end
- Verify email delivery and link expiration
- Test resend functionality and rate limiting
- Document configuration and deployment requirements

## HIPAA Compliance Considerations
- Use HIPAA-compliant email service (AWS SES with BAA)
- Ensure verification emails don't contain PHI
- Log email verification attempts securely
- Implement proper rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Configuration Analysis and Update
1. Analyze current SuperTokens configuration
2. Update email verification mode from OPTIONAL to REQUIRED
3. Test configuration changes in development

### Phase 2: Email Service Setup
1. Configure email service provider
2. Set up email templates and branding
3. Test email delivery functionality

### Phase 3: Auth Flow Updates
1. Remove manual verification checks from auth controller
2. Update auth guards and middleware
3. Test authentication flow with required verification

### Phase 4: End-to-End Testing
1. Test complete user registration and verification flow
2. Test resend verification functionality
3. Test error handling for expired/invalid links
4. Verify HIPAA compliance of email content

## Success Criteria
- Email verification is enforced for all new user accounts
- Verification emails are delivered reliably with proper branding
- Users cannot access protected resources until email is verified
- Resend functionality works with proper rate limiting
- All error scenarios are handled gracefully
- HIPAA compliance is maintained throughout the flow
