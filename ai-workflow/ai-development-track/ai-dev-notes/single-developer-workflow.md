# Single Developer Workflow for Heartly

## Adapted Development Process

### Feature Development Cycle (Simplified)

#### 1. Planning Phase (1-2 hours per feature)
- **Requirements Analysis**: Define what the feature needs to do
- **Technical Design**: Sketch out the implementation approach
- **Compliance Check**: Ensure HIPAA requirements are met
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Define how you'll know it's done

#### 2. Development Phase (Implementation)
- **Backend First**: Build API endpoints and business logic
- **Database Changes**: Create migrations and update schema
- **Frontend Integration**: Build UI components and connect to API
- **Testing**: Write tests as you go

#### 3. Review Phase (Self-Review)
- **Code Review**: Use checklist to review your own code
- **Testing**: Run all tests and manual testing
- **Documentation**: Update docs and add comments
- **Security Check**: Verify compliance and security

#### 4. Deployment Phase
- **Staging Test**: Deploy to staging environment
- **Final Testing**: End-to-end testing
- **Production Deploy**: Deploy to production
- **Monitoring**: Watch for issues post-deployment

### Daily Development Routine

#### Morning (30 minutes)
- Review yesterday's work
- Plan today's tasks
- Check for any issues or bugs
- Review compliance requirements

#### Development Time (4-6 hours)
- Focus on one feature at a time
- Write tests alongside code
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Take breaks every 90 minutes

#### End of Day (30 minutes)
- Review what was accomplished
- Plan tomorrow's priorities
- Update documentation
- Commit final changes

### Quality Assurance Checklist

- API endpoint documentation
- Database schema comments

#### User Documentation
- Feature overview for each major component
- Step-by-step guides for complex workflows
- Troubleshooting guides
- FAQ sections

#### Technical Documentation
- Architecture decisions
- Database schema changes
- API changes and migrations
- Deployment procedures

### Risk Management for Single Developer

#### Technical Risks
- **Knowledge Silos**: Document everything thoroughly
- **Single Point of Failure**: Regular backups and version control
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to defined requirements
- **Technical Debt**: Regular refactoring sessions

#### Compliance Risks
- **HIPAA Violations**: Regular compliance audits
- **Data Breaches**: Implement security best practices
- **Audit Failures**: Maintain comprehensive audit logs
- **Privacy Issues**: Regular privacy impact assessments

### Tools and Automation

#### Essential Tools
- **IDE**: VS Code with extensions for TypeScript, NestJS, Next.js
- **Version Control**: Git with clear commit messages
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Cypress for E2E
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, SonarQube
- **Documentation**: JSDoc, Swagger, Markdown

#### Automation Scripts
- **Build Scripts**: Automated build and test processes
- **Deployment Scripts**: Automated deployment to staging/production
- **Backup Scripts**: Automated database and code backups
- **Monitoring Scripts**: Automated health checks and alerts

### Communication and Feedback

#### Self-Review Process
- **Daily Reviews**: What worked, what didn't
- **Weekly Reviews**: Progress assessment and planning
- **Monthly Reviews**: Architecture and process improvements

#### User Feedback Integration
- **Beta Testing**: Regular user testing sessions
- **Feedback Collection**: User feedback forms and surveys
- **Issue Tracking**: Bug reports and feature requests
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular process refinement

### Success Metrics

#### Development Metrics
- **Velocity**: Features completed per week
- **Quality**: Bugs per feature, test coverage
- **Performance**: Response times, load handling
- **Security**: Security incidents, compliance audits

#### User Metrics
- **Adoption**: User engagement and feature usage
- **Satisfaction**: User feedback scores
- **Efficiency**: Time saved in workflows
- **Errors**: User error rates and support requests

### Getting Started Action Items

- [ ] Create basic project structure
- [ ] Set up testing framework

#### Week 2: Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Implement authentication system
- [ ] Set up database schema
- [ ] Create basic CRUD operations
- [ ] Implement audit logging

#### Week 3: First Features
- [ ] Build client management
- [ ] Create facility management
- [ ] Implement basic reporting
- [ ] Set up PDF generation

#### Week 4: Quality and Documentation
- [ ] Complete test coverage
- [ ] Write user documentation

- [ ] Deploy to production

### Remember These Principles

1. **Quality First**: Don't sacrifice quality for speed
2. **Document Everything**: Future you will thank you
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Automated testing saves time
4. **Security Always**: HIPAA compliance is non-negotiable
5. **Iterate Often**: Small, frequent improvements
6. **Stay Organized**: Clear structure and processes
7. **Ask for Help**: Use community resources when needed
8. **Celebrate Wins**: Acknowledge your progress

This workflow is designed to maintain the same quality standards as a team while being practical for a single developer. Adapt it based on your specific needs and constraints.
