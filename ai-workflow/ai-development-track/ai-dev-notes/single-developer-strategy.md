# Single Developer Strategy for Heartly

## Consolidated Role Responsibilities

As a single developer, you'll need to wear multiple hats while maintaining the same quality standards. Here's how to consolidate the core team responsibilities:

### Primary Responsibilities (Daily Focus)

1. **Technical Development (40% of time)**
   - Backend API development (NestJS)
   - Frontend development (Next.js)
   - Database design and migrations
   - Authentication system (SuperTokens)
   - API integration and testing

2. **Security & Compliance (25% of time)**
   - HIPAA compliance implementation
   - Audit logging and data protection
   - Security best practices
   - Privacy controls and access management

3. **User Experience & Design (20% of time)**
   - UI/UX design and implementation
   - Workflow optimization
   - Accessibility compliance
   - User feedback integration

4. **Quality Assurance (15% of time)**
   - Testing strategy and implementation
   - Bug fixes and maintenance
   - Performance optimization
   - Documentation

### Simplified Workflow Definition of Ready

For each feature, ensure you have:

- ✅ **Technical Feasibility Check**: Architecture review and technical planning
- ✅ **Compliance Review**: HIPAA requirements and audit trail planning
- ✅ **UX Design**: Wireframes or mockups (even simple ones)
- ✅ **Test Plan**: Basic acceptance criteria and testing approach
- ✅ **Documentation Plan**: What needs to be documented for users/developers

### Development Priorities for Single Developer

1. **Core Infrastructure First**
   - Database schema and migrations
   - Authentication system
   - Basic CRUD operations
   - Audit logging framework

2. **Essential Features**
   - Client management
   - Facility management
   - Basic reporting
   - PDF generation

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Complex workflows
   - Advanced reporting
   - Integration features
   - Performance optimizations

### Time Management Strategy

**Weekly Schedule:**
- **Monday**: Planning and architecture review
- **Tuesday-Thursday**: Core development
- **Friday**: Testing, documentation, and cleanup

**Daily Routine:**
- Morning: Code review and planning
- Midday: Active development
- Afternoon: Testing and documentation

### Quality Assurance for Single Developer

1. **Automated Testing**
   - Unit tests for all business logic
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - E2E tests for critical user flows

2. **Code Review Process**
   - Self-review checklist
   - Static analysis tools
   - Regular refactoring sessions

3. **Documentation Standards**
   - Inline code comments
   - API documentation
   - User guides for each feature

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Backup Strategy**
   - Regular code commits
   - Database backups
   - Configuration management

2. **Knowledge Management**
   - Detailed documentation
   - Decision logs
   - Architecture decisions record

3. **Compliance Maintenance**
   - Regular HIPAA compliance checks
   - Audit log reviews
   - Security assessments

### Tools and Resources

**Essential Tools:**
- Git for version control
- Docker for development environment
- Automated testing framework
- Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier)
- Documentation generator

**Time-Saving Strategies:**
- Use existing libraries and frameworks
- Implement reusable components
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Use templates for common patterns

### Success Metrics

Track these metrics to ensure quality:
- Code coverage percentage
- Number of bugs per feature
- User feedback scores
- Performance benchmarks
- Compliance audit results

### Getting Started Checklist

- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Establish coding standards
- [ ] Create testing framework
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Implement basic audit logging
- [ ] Create documentation structure
- [ ] Plan first feature implementation

Remember: Quality over speed. It's better to build a solid foundation than to rush features that need constant fixing.
