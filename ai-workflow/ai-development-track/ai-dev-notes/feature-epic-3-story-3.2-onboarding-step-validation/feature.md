## Story Overview
**Track B Story 3.2**: Onboarding Step Validation and Progression
**Epic**: Chapter 3 - Onboarding System Fix
**Priority**: High (Critical for user adoption and healthcare facility setup)

## Requirements Analysis

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Each onboarding step validates required data before proceeding
- [x] Progress is saved between steps
- [x] Users can go back to previous steps
- [x] Onboarding completion is tracked in database
- [x] Incomplete onboarding prevents access to main application
- [x] Step validation provides meaningful feedback
- [x] Navigation controls are intuitive and secure
- [x] Healthcare-specific validation rules are enforced

### Healthcare Industry Considerations
- **Facility Setup Validation**: ARF/ARTF facilities must have complete information for compliance
- **Multi-Step Workflow**: Healthcare onboarding requires structured, validated progression
- **Audit Trail**: All onboarding progress must be tracked for compliance purposes
- **Data Integrity**: Validation ensures accurate facility and staff information

## Technical Approach

### Backend Implementation
1. **Onboarding API Endpoints**: 
   - GET `/users/onboarding-status` - Get current onboarding state
   - POST `/users/onboarding-progress` - Update step progress
   - POST `/users/complete-onboarding` - Complete onboarding process

2. **Database Integration**: 
   - User entity tracks `onboarding_step` and `onboarding_completed_at`
   - Progress persistence with validation and error handling
   - Audit logging for onboarding events

3. **Validation Layer**: 
   - Email verification required for all onboarding operations
   - Step validation with proper error responses
   - Healthcare-specific business rule validation

### Frontend Implementation
1. **useOnboarding Hook**: 
   - Comprehensive state management for onboarding flow
   - Navigation controls with validation integration
   - Progress persistence and error handling

2. **OnboardingProgress Component**: 
   - Visual progress indicator with step validation feedback
   - Integrated navigation controls (Previous/Next)
   - Real-time validation status and error display
   - Healthcare-specific guidance and warnings

3. **Step-Specific Validation**: 
   - Facilities validation with healthcare compliance checks
   - Extensible validation framework for additional steps
   - User-friendly error messages and guidance
