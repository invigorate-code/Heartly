# Story 3.1: Facility Creation API Integration - Errors and Solutions

## üî¥ Issues Found

### 1. **Facility CRUD Operations Not Using Backend API**
- **Location**: `/app/onboarding/facilities/page.tsx`
- **Problem**: All facility operations had TODO comments and were using local state only
- **Solution**: Replaced mock implementations with actual API calls using the facility service

### 2. **getUserAndFacilities Endpoint Not Implemented**
- **Location**: `/app/api/getUserAndFacilities/route.ts`
- **Problem**: Returned 501 error with message about Supabase migration
- **Solution**: Implemented proper endpoint using SuperTokens session and backend API calls

### 3. **Missing Room Count Field**
- **Location**: Facility form in onboarding page
- **Problem**: Backend requires `roomCount` but frontend form didn't include it
- **Solution**: Added room count input field to the form alongside projected client count

### 4. **Missing Optional Fields in Form**
- **Location**: Facility form in onboarding page
- **Problem**: Phone and email fields were not included in the form
- **Solution**: Added phone and email as optional fields in the form

### 5. **Type Mismatches Between Frontend and Backend**
- **Problem**: Frontend used snake_case (e.g., `projected_client_count`) while backend expects camelCase (e.g., `projectedClientCount`)
- **Solution**: Created proper mapping in API calls to convert between formats

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### Created Facility API Service (`/lib/api/facility.ts`)
- Centralized all facility API calls
- Proper error handling with meaningful messages
- Type-safe interfaces for requests and responses
- Uses existing `apiCall` utility for authentication

### Fixed getUserAndFacilities Endpoint
- Uses SuperTokens session for authentication
- Fetches user info from `/api/user/getBasicUserInfo`
- Fetches facilities from `/api/facility/getLoggedInUserFacilities`
- Returns properly formatted data for the frontend

### Updated Onboarding Facilities Page
- All CRUD operations now use the facility API service
- Added toast notifications for success/error feedback
- Proper state management with API responses
- Added loading states and error handling

### Enhanced Facility Model
- Added missing fields: `room_count`, `phone`, `email`
- Made optional fields properly typed as optional
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

## üéØ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a new facility through onboarding
- [ ] Edit an existing facility
- [ ] Delete a facility
- [ ] Verify facilities load on page refresh
- [ ] Test validation errors
- [ ] Verify room count is saved correctly
- [ ] Test optional fields (phone, email)
- [ ] Verify tenant context is maintained

## üìù Notes

- The backend already has proper authentication guards and email verification checks
- Facility deletion is a soft delete (marks as inactive)
- Only OWNER role can delete/restore facilities
- All endpoints require email verification
