# GitHub Actions CI Setup

## Date: 2025-08-07

### What was implemented:
1. Created GitHub Actions workflow file at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
2. Configured CI pipeline with three main jobs:
   - **Backend**: Build, lint, unit tests, and e2e tests with PostgreSQL service
   - **Frontend**: Build and test
   - **Integration**: Type generation and sync

### Key Features:
- Runs on push to main/dev branches and on pull requests
- Uses PostgreSQL service container for backend tests
- Proper environment variable setup for both frontend and backend
- Caches pnpm dependencies for faster builds
- Separate jobs for better parallelization and clear failure identification

### Workflow Triggers:
- Push to main or dev branches
- Pull requests targeting main or dev branches
- Manual workflow dispatch

### Test Results:
To test the workflow locally, you can:
1. Push changes to a branch and create a PR
2. Check GitHub Actions tab in the repository
3. Monitor the workflow execution

### Next Steps:
- Add code coverage reporting
- Consider adding deployment workflows for staging/production
- Add security scanning (e.g., dependency vulnerability checks)
- Consider adding Docker build and push for containerized deployments
