# Script Organization and CI Enhancement

## Date: 2025-08-07

### What was accomplished:
1. **Organized Script Files**
   - Created structured directories under `/scripts`:
     - `/scripts/build` - Build and type generation scripts
     - `/scripts/git` - Git workflow and commit helpers
     - `/scripts/test` - Test and validation scripts
   - Moved all loose scripts from root to appropriate directories

2. **Updated Package.json**
   - Added comprehensive npm scripts for:
     - Building both frontend and backend
     - Running tests (unit, e2e, integration)
     - Type generation with correct path
     - Integration test scripts
   - Added shortcuts for running specific test scripts

3. **Enhanced GitHub Actions CI**
   - Updated integration job to include PostgreSQL service
   - Added script permission setup
   - Added documentation for available test scripts
   - Improved job naming for clarity

### Files Organized:
- Test scripts: `test-email-verification.sh`, `test-password-reset.sh`, `test-roles-integration.sh`, `smoke-test-roles.js`
- Git scripts: `commit-with-progress.sh`, `amend-with-progress.sh`, `dev-progress.sh`
- Build scripts: `generate-types.js`

### New Commands Available:
```bash
# Build commands
pnpm run build           # Build both frontend and backend
pnpm run build:backend   # Build backend only
pnpm run build:frontend  # Build frontend only

# Test commands
pnpm run test                   # Run all tests
pnpm run test:backend          # Backend unit tests
pnpm run test:frontend         # Frontend tests
pnpm run test:e2e              # End-to-end tests
pnpm run test:integration      # Role integration tests
pnpm run test:email-verification  # Email verification tests
pnpm run test:password-reset   # Password reset tests

# Development
pnpm run dev            # Start both frontend and backend
pnpm run generate:types # Generate TypeScript types
pnpm run sync-types     # Build and generate types
pnpm run lint           # Run linting
```

### Next Steps:
- Consider adding pre-commit hooks that run tests
- Add coverage reporting to CI pipeline
- Consider containerizing test scripts for CI environment
- Add performance benchmarking scripts
