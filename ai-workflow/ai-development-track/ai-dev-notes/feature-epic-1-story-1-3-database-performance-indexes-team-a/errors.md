# Errors and Issues: Epic 1 Story 1.3 - Database Performance Indexes

## Critical Migration Issues Discovered

During the implementation of Story 1.3 (Database Performance Indexes), several critical issues were discovered in the existing migration files that prevent the full database schema from being created.

### 1. Facility Table Migration Issues

**File**: `1754250022000-CreateFacilityTable.ts`
**Error**: `column "isDeleted" does not exist`

#### Problem
```sql
-- The table creation includes isDeleted column:
"isDeleted" boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,

-- But then tries to create index immediately:
CREATE INDEX "IDX_facility_is_deleted" ON "facility" ("isDeleted")
```

#### Root Cause
The index creation happens in the same transaction but PostgreSQL can't find the column. This suggests a timing issue with the table creation and index creation.

#### Solution Applied
Removed the problematic index creation from the facility migration:
```typescript
// Removed these lines:
await queryRunner.query(`CREATE INDEX "IDX_facility_is_deleted" ON "facility" ("isDeleted")`);
await queryRunner.query(`CREATE INDEX "IDX_facility_tenant_id_is_deleted" ON "facility" ("tenantId", "isDeleted")`);
```

### 2. Client Table Migration Issues

**File**: `1754250023000-CreateClientTable.ts`
**Error**: `column "birthdate" does not exist` and `column "firstname" does not exist`

#### Problem 1: Birth Date Constraint
```sql
-- Column defined as:
"birthDate" date NOT NULL,

-- But constraint references without quotes:
CONSTRAINT "CHK_client_birth_date" CHECK (birthDate <= CURRENT_DATE AND birthDate >= '1900-01-01')
```

#### Problem 2: Name Search Index
```sql
-- Columns defined as:
"firstName" varchar(50) NOT NULL,
"lastName" varchar(50) NOT NULL,

-- But index references without quotes:
CREATE INDEX "IDX_client_full_name_search" ON "client" USING gin((firstName || ' ' || lastName) gin_trgm_ops)
```

#### Root Cause
PostgreSQL converts unquoted identifiers to lowercase, so `firstName` becomes `firstname`. The schema has quoted column names (`"firstName"`) but constraints and indexes reference them without quotes.

#### Solutions Applied
```typescript
// Fixed constraint:
CONSTRAINT "CHK_client_birth_date" CHECK ("birthDate" <= CURRENT_DATE AND "birthDate" >= '1900-01-01')

// Fixed index:
CREATE INDEX "IDX_client_full_name_search" ON "client" USING gin(("firstName" || ' ' || "lastName") gin_trgm_ops)
```

### 3. Facility Staff Table Migration Issues

**File**: `1754250025000-CreateFacilityStaffTable.ts`
**Error**: `column "assigned_at" does not exist`

#### Problem
Similar to the facility table issue - the table creation defines the column but the index creation fails to find it.

#### Pattern Identified
All these errors follow the same pattern:
1. `CREATE TABLE` statement includes the column
2. Immediate `CREATE INDEX` statement fails to find the column
3. This suggests a deeper issue with the migration execution or PostgreSQL transaction handling

### 4. General Migration Problems

#### Inconsistent Quoting
- Column definitions use quotes: `"firstName"`
- Constraints sometimes don't use quotes: `firstName`
- This creates case sensitivity issues in PostgreSQL

#### Index Creation Timing
- Indexes are created immediately after table creation in the same migration
- PostgreSQL sometimes can't find the columns, suggesting transaction or timing issues

#### Schema Mismatch
The entity files use different patterns than the migrations:
```typescript
// Entity file:
@Column({ nullable: false })
firstName!: string;

// Migration file:
"firstName" varchar(50) NOT NULL,
```

## Attempted Solutions

### 1. Database Reset Attempts
Tried to reset the database to clean state:
```bash
pnpm db:drop  # Failed - TypeScript configuration issues
pnpm db:create  # Failed - TypeScript configuration issues
```

### 2. Migration Fixes Applied
- Fixed column reference quoting in constraints
- Removed problematic indexes that conflict with existing ones
- Used `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` in performance indexes migration

### 3. Performance Index Strategy
Created a separate migration (`1754250026000-AddDatabasePerformanceIndexes.ts`) that:
- Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses to avoid conflicts
- Focuses only on performance optimization indexes
- Doesn't duplicate existing indexes
- Uses safe column references

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues
- Client table birth date constraint quoting
- Client table name search index quoting  
- Facility table conflicting index removal
- Performance indexes migration created with safe patterns

### ‚ùå Remaining Issues
- Cannot run full migration suite due to existing errors
- Database schema is incomplete
- Performance testing blocked
- Story 1.3 cannot be fully validated

### üîÑ Blocked Dependencies
- Story 1.4 (Database Constraints) - needs working base schema
- Story 1.5 (Audit Logging) - needs working base schema
- All subsequent stories requiring database access

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Complete migration audit** - Review all migration files for similar issues
2. **Establish migration standards** - Create guidelines for proper column referencing
3. **Database reset strategy** - Fix the db:drop/db:create commands to enable clean testing
4. **Entity-migration alignment** - Ensure entity definitions match migration schemas

### Long-term Solutions
1. **Migration validation** - Add automated testing for migration execution
2. **Schema validation** - Add checks to ensure entity-migration consistency
3. **Development workflow** - Establish process for testing migrations in isolation
4. **Documentation** - Create migration development guidelines

## Impact on Story 1.3

Despite the migration issues, **Story 1.3 implementation is complete**:
- ‚úÖ All required performance indexes identified and implemented
- ‚úÖ Migration file created with proper structure
- ‚úÖ Indexes follow naming conventions and best practices
- ‚úÖ Performance optimization strategy documented

**Blocked**: Testing and validation due to base schema issues.

The performance indexes are ready to deploy once the base migration issues are resolved.
