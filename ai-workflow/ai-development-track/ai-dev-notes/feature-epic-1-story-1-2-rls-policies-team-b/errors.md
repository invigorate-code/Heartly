# Epic 1 Story 1.2: RLS Policies - Error Resolution

## Error 1: CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY in Transaction Block

### Issue
```
QueryFailedError: CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY cannot run inside a transaction block
```

### Root Cause
TypeORM runs all migrations within a transaction block by default. PostgreSQL does not allow `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` within transactions because it needs to commit intermediate states.

### Solution
Removed `CONCURRENTLY` keyword from all index creation statements:
- Changed: `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS ...`
- To: `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS ...`

### Impact
- Migrations now run successfully within transactions
- Index creation may briefly lock tables during creation
- For production, consider creating indexes manually with CONCURRENTLY outside migrations

## Error 2: GitHub Copilot Review Issues

### Issues Identified
Multiple commits were made to address GitHub Copilot's code review suggestions:
1. Proper error handling in RLS context middleware
2. Session validation improvements
3. Type safety enhancements

### Resolution
All GitHub Copilot suggestions were implemented and merged into the branch.

## Lessons Learned
1. Always test migrations before committing
2. Be aware of PostgreSQL transaction limitations
3. Consider production deployment strategies for index creation
4. Use automated code review tools to catch potential issues early
