# Epic 1 Story 1.2: Implement Row Level Security (RLS) Policies (Team B)

## Overview
This story implements comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables in the Heartly Healthcare Platform to ensure proper tenant isolation and role-based access control.

## Implementation Details

### 1. RLS Policies Created

#### User Table Policy
- **Policy Name**: `user_tenant_isolation`
- **Purpose**: Users can only see users in their tenant
- **Rule**: `tenantId = current_setting('app.tenant_id', true)::uuid`

#### Client Table Policy
- **Policy Name**: `client_facility_access`
- **Purpose**: Role-based access to clients within facilities
- **Rules**:
  - OWNER/ADMIN: Can see all clients in their tenant
  - STAFF: Can only see clients in their assigned facilities

#### Facility Table Policy
- **Policy Name**: `facility_tenant_access`
- **Purpose**: Role-based access to facilities
- **Rules**:
  - OWNER: Can see all facilities in their tenant
  - ADMIN/STAFF: Can only see facilities they're assigned to

#### Tenant Table Policy
- **Policy Name**: `tenant_self_access`
- **Purpose**: Users can only see their own tenant
- **Rule**: `id = current_setting('app.tenant_id', true)::uuid`

#### Audit Log Policy
- **Policy Name**: `audit_log_role_based_access`
- **Purpose**: Role-based access to audit logs
- **Rules**:
  - OWNER: Can see all audit logs in their tenant
  - ADMIN: Can see audit logs for their assigned facilities
  - STAFF: Can only see their own audit logs

### 2. Performance Indexes Created
- `idx_user_tenant_id`: Optimizes user tenant queries
- `idx_client_tenant_facility`: Optimizes client facility queries
- `idx_facility_tenant_id`: Optimizes facility tenant queries
- `idx_audit_log_tenant_facility`: Optimizes audit log queries
- `idx_facility_staff_user_facility`: Optimizes facility staff queries

### 3. RLS Context Middleware
Created middleware to set PostgreSQL session variables for RLS policies:
- Extracts user context from SuperTokens session
- Sets `app.tenant_id`, `app.user_id`, and `app.user_role` variables
- These variables are used by RLS policies to enforce access control

## Files Modified
1. `heartly-backend/src/database/migrations/1754252063000-implement-row-level-security-policies.ts`
   - Complete RLS implementation with all policies
   - Performance indexes for RLS optimization
   - Proper rollback support

2. `heartly-backend/src/utils/middleware/rls-context.middleware.ts`
   - Middleware to set database context for RLS
   - Integrates with SuperTokens session management
   - Handles cleanup on response completion

## Security Considerations
1. **Tenant Isolation**: All data access is strictly isolated by tenant
2. **Role-Based Access**: Different access levels for OWNER, ADMIN, and STAFF
3. **Facility-Based Access**: Staff members can only access data for their assigned facilities
4. **Audit Trail Protection**: Audit logs are protected based on user role
5. **Session Integration**: RLS context is automatically set from user session

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test cross-tenant access attempts (should fail)
2. Test role-based access for each user type
3. Test facility assignment enforcement
4. Test audit log visibility rules
5. Test performance with large datasets

## Migration Notes
- Fixed CONCURRENTLY index creation issue (cannot run in transaction)
- All indexes use IF NOT EXISTS for idempotency
- Proper rollback support with policy cleanup
- Preserves existing facility policy from previous migrations

## Next Steps
- Implement integration tests for RLS policies
- Add monitoring for RLS policy violations
- Document RLS context usage in API endpoints
- Consider adding RLS bypass for system operations
