# Error Handling & Troubleshooting: RLS Policies

## üö® Common Issues

### RLS Policy Creation Errors
- **Issue**: Policy syntax errors or invalid conditions
- **Solution**: Verify PostgreSQL RLS syntax and test policies incrementally

### Performance Issues
- **Issue**: RLS policies causing slow queries
- **Solution**: Add appropriate indexes and optimize policy conditions

### Authentication Context Issues
- **Issue**: Policies not recognizing SuperTokens user context
- **Solution**: Verify session context is properly passed to database queries

### Cross-Tenant Data Leakage
- **Issue**: Users accessing data from other tenants
- **Solution**: Thoroughly test policies and verify tenant_id filtering

## üîß Debugging Steps

1. **Test Policy Syntax**: Create policies incrementally and test each one
2. **Verify User Context**: Ensure current user and tenant information is available
3. **Check Query Performance**: Monitor query execution times with RLS enabled
4. **Test Access Controls**: Verify different user roles have appropriate access
5. **Validate Isolation**: Confirm cross-tenant data access is prevented

## üõ†Ô∏è Validation Rules

### RLS Policy Requirements
- All policies must include tenant_id filtering where applicable
- Role-based conditions must use SuperTokens role information
- Policies must not allow cross-tenant data access
- Performance impact must be acceptable (< 50ms additional query time)

### Testing Requirements
- Test with multiple tenants and users
- Verify role-based access works correctly
- Confirm facility-based filtering is accurate
- Validate audit log privacy is maintained
