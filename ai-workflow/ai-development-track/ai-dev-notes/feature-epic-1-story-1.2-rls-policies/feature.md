# Feature: Implement Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
**Epic**: 1 - The Foundation Crisis  
**Story**: 1.2 - Implement Row Level Security (RLS) Policies  
**Status**: Completed  
**Started**: 2025-08-03  
**Completed**: 2025-08-03  

## üéØ Implementation Plan

### Overview
Implement comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all database tables to ensure proper data isolation between tenants and role-based access control. This is critical for HIPAA compliance and multi-tenant architecture security.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement RLS policy for User table (users can only see users in their tenant)
- [x] Implement RLS policy for Client table (users can only see clients in their facilities)
- [x] Implement RLS policy for Facility table (users can only see facilities in their tenant)
- [x] Implement RLS policy for Tenant table (users can only see their own tenant)
- [x] Implement RLS policy for UserActionAuditLog table (users can only see logs for their actions)
- [x] All policies include proper role-based access (OWNER, ADMIN, STAFF)
- [x] Policies are tested with different user roles and tenants
- [x] Policies prevent cross-tenant data access
- [x] Policies allow proper data access within tenant boundaries

## üîß Technical Approach

### RLS Policy Strategy
1. **Tenant-Level Isolation**: All tables with `tenant_id` field require tenant-scoped access
2. **Role-Based Access**: Different permission levels based on SuperTokens roles (OWNER, ADMIN, STAFF)
3. **Facility-Scoped Access**: Client-related data filtered by user's facility assignments
4. **Audit Log Privacy**: Users can only see their own audit logs unless they have administrative privileges

### Database Configuration
- Enable RLS on all tenant-scoped tables
- Create policies that work with SuperTokens user context
- Ensure policies don't impact performance significantly
- Test policies with realistic data scenarios

## üìã Implementation Steps

1. **Analyze Current Schema**: Review existing entities and RLS implementation
2. **Create User Table RLS Policy**: Tenant-scoped user access with role-based permissions
3. **Create Client Table RLS Policy**: Facility-scoped client access based on user assignments
4. **Create Facility Table RLS Policy**: Tenant-scoped facility access with role-based permissions
5. **Create Tenant Table RLS Policy**: Users can only access their own tenant data
6. **Create UserActionAuditLog RLS Policy**: Privacy-focused audit log access
7. **Test All Policies**: Comprehensive testing with different user roles and scenarios
8. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure policies don't significantly impact query performance

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Test Scenarios
1. **Cross-Tenant Isolation**: Verify users cannot access data from other tenants
2. **Role-Based Access**: Test different permission levels for OWNER, ADMIN, STAFF roles
3. **Facility Access Control**: Verify facility-based data filtering works correctly
4. **Audit Log Privacy**: Ensure users can only see appropriate audit logs
5. **Edge Cases**: Test user transfers, role changes, and facility reassignments

### Test Data Setup
- Multiple tenants with different users and roles
- Multiple facilities within tenants
- Client data assigned to different facilities
- Audit logs from different users and actions

## üîç Code Review Notes

### Implementation Details
**Migration Created**: `1754252063000-implement-row-level-security-policies.ts`
- Enables RLS on all tenant-scoped tables (user, client, facility, tenant, user_action_audit_log)
- Creates comprehensive RLS policies for each table with role-based access
- Adds performance indexes to optimize RLS policy queries
- Includes proper rollback functionality

**Entity Updates**:
- Added explicit `tenantId` column to `FacilityEntity`
- Added explicit `facilityId` column to `ClientEntity`
- Ensured all entities have proper tenant isolation

**Services Created**:
- `RlsContextService`: Manages database context for RLS policies
- Updated `BaseTenantService`: Integrates with RLS context management
- `RlsContextMiddleware`: Sets database context from SuperTokens session

**Testing**:
- Unit tests for `RlsContextService`
- E2E tests for all RLS policies with different user roles and scenarios
- Cross-tenant isolation verification

### RLS Policy Details

**User Table Policy**: `user_tenant_isolation`
- Users can only see users in their tenant
- Uses `current_setting('app.tenant_id')` for tenant filtering

**Client Table Policy**: `client_facility_access`
- OWNER/ADMIN can see all clients in their tenant
- STAFF can only see clients in their assigned facilities
- Uses facility_staff junction table for staff access control

**Facility Table Policy**: `facility_tenant_access`
- OWNER can see all facilities in their tenant
- ADMIN/STAFF can only see facilities they're assigned to
- Replaces the previous basic facility policy

**Tenant Table Policy**: `tenant_self_access`
- Users can only see their own tenant data
- Complete tenant isolation

**Audit Log Policy**: `audit_log_role_based_access`
- OWNER can see all audit logs in their tenant
- ADMIN can see audit logs for their facilities
- STAFF can only see their own audit logs
- Privacy-focused approach to audit log access

### Performance Optimizations
- Created indexes for tenant filtering: `idx_user_tenant_id`, `idx_facility_tenant_id`
- Composite indexes for complex queries: `idx_client_tenant_facility`, `idx_audit_log_tenant_facility`
- Junction table index: `idx_facility_staff_user_facility`
- All indexes created with CONCURRENTLY to avoid blocking

### Security Considerations
- All policies must prevent data leakage between tenants
- Role-based access must be consistently enforced
- Policies work with SuperTokens authentication context via database session variables
- Performance impact minimized with proper indexing

### HIPAA Compliance
- PHI data is properly isolated at the database level
- Audit logs maintain appropriate access controls
- No unauthorized access to client information possible
- Complete tenant isolation for regulatory compliance
- Field-level security through RLS policies
