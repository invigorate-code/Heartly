# Test Implementation: RLS Policies

## üß™ Test Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test individual RLS policies in isolation
- Verify policy conditions work correctly
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Integration Tests  
- Test RLS policies with actual database queries
- Verify SuperTokens authentication integration
- Test multi-tenant data isolation

### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete user workflows with RLS enabled
- Verify role-based access across the application
- Test facility switching and data filtering

## üìã Test Cases

### User Table RLS Tests
- [ ] Users can only see users in their tenant
- [ ] OWNER role can see all users in tenant
- [ ] ADMIN role can see facility-specific users
- [ ] STAFF role can see limited user information
- [ ] Cross-tenant user access is blocked

### Client Table RLS Tests
- [ ] Users can only see clients in their assigned facilities
- [ ] Role-based client access works correctly
- [ ] Cross-tenant client access is blocked
- [ ] Facility reassignment updates access correctly

### Facility Table RLS Tests
- [ ] Users can only see facilities in their tenant
- [ ] Role-based facility access works correctly
- [ ] Cross-tenant facility access is blocked
- [ ] Facility switching updates context correctly

### Tenant Table RLS Tests
- [ ] Users can only see their own tenant data
- [ ] Cross-tenant access is completely blocked
- [ ] Tenant isolation is maintained

### UserActionAuditLog RLS Tests
- [ ] Users can only see their own audit logs (STAFF)
- [ ] ADMIN can see facility-specific audit logs
- [ ] OWNER can see all tenant audit logs
- [ ] Cross-tenant audit log access is blocked

## üîç Performance Tests

### Query Performance
- [ ] RLS policies don't significantly impact query performance
- [ ] Indexes are properly utilized with RLS conditions
- [ ] Complex queries remain performant
- [ ] Bulk operations work efficiently

### Scalability Tests
- [ ] RLS performance with large datasets
- [ ] Multiple concurrent users with RLS
- [ ] Cross-facility queries remain efficient

## üìä Test Data Setup

### Multi-Tenant Test Data
```sql
-- Test tenants
INSERT INTO tenant (id, name) VALUES 
  ('tenant-1', 'Facility Network A'),
  ('tenant-2', 'Facility Network B');

-- Test facilities
INSERT INTO facility (id, tenant_id, name) VALUES
  ('facility-1a', 'tenant-1', 'Facility 1A'),
  ('facility-1b', 'tenant-1', 'Facility 1B'),
  ('facility-2a', 'tenant-2', 'Facility 2A');

-- Test users with different roles
INSERT INTO user (id, tenant_id, email, role) VALUES
  ('user-owner-1', 'tenant-1', 'owner1@test.com', 'OWNER'),
  ('user-admin-1a', 'tenant-1', 'admin1a@test.com', 'ADMIN'),
  ('user-staff-1a', 'tenant-1', 'staff1a@test.com', 'STAFF'),
  ('user-owner-2', 'tenant-2', 'owner2@test.com', 'OWNER');

-- Test clients
INSERT INTO client (id, tenant_id, facility_id, name) VALUES
  ('client-1a-1', 'tenant-1', 'facility-1a', 'Client 1A-1'),
  ('client-1a-2', 'tenant-1', 'facility-1a', 'Client 1A-2'),
  ('client-1b-1', 'tenant-1', 'facility-1b', 'Client 1B-1'),
  ('client-2a-1', 'tenant-2', 'facility-2a', 'Client 2A-1');
```
