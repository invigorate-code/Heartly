## üéØ **Epic Story Plan: The Real State of Heartly**

### üìä **Current State Assessment**

**‚úÖ What's Actually Built:**
- **Basic Backend Foundation**: NestJS with TypeScript, PostgreSQL, TypeORM setup
- **SuperTokens Integration**: Basic authentication setup with email/password
- **Basic Entity Structure**: User, Client, Facility, Tenant entities with basic relationships
- **Frontend Foundation**: Next.js 14 with basic routing and HeroUI components
- **Basic Auth UI**: Login and signup forms (partially functional)
- **Basic Onboarding UI**: Facility creation interface (partially functional)

**‚ùå What's NOT Actually Working:**
- **Tenant Isolation**: RLS policies are incomplete, only one basic policy exists
- **Role-Based Access**: SuperTokens roles are configured but not properly implemented in the application
- **Email Confirmation**: SuperTokens email verification is set to "OPTIONAL" mode
- **Onboarding Flow**: The onboarding process is incomplete and has broken functionality
- **Multi-Facility Access**: No proper facility switching or access controls
- **User Management**: Basic CRUD but no proper role-based permissions
- **Database Migrations**: Only one test migration exists, no proper schema setup

**üîß What's Partially Implemented:**
- **Authentication Flow**: Basic signup/login but missing proper session management
- **User Context**: Basic user context but not properly integrated with SuperTokens
- **API Structure**: Basic API modules but missing core functionality
- **Frontend Routing**: Basic routing but missing proper authentication guards
