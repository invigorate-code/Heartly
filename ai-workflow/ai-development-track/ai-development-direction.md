- **Structure**: Follow existing patterns in `heartly-backend/src/` and `heartly-frontend/app/`
- **Imports**: Use absolute imports where possible, organize imports logically
- **Exports**: Use named exports for better tree-shaking

### **Database Standards**
- **Migrations**: Always create proper TypeORM migrations for schema changes
- **RLS Policies**: Implement Row Level Security for all tenant-scoped tables
- **Indexes**: Add appropriate indexes for performance optimization
- **Constraints**: Use database constraints for data integrity
- **Audit Logging**: Implement comprehensive audit trails for compliance

### **API Standards**
- **RESTful Design**: Follow REST conventions for endpoint design
- **Validation**: Use DTOs with class-validator decorators
- **Error Responses**: Consistent error response format across all endpoints
- **Authentication**: Proper SuperTokens integration with role-based access
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate rate limiting for security

### **Frontend Standards**
- **Component Structure**: Use functional components with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Use React hooks and context appropriately
- **Styling**: Use TailwindCSS utility classes, avoid custom CSS when possible
- **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG compliance for all components
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with proper breakpoints

## üõ°Ô∏è **HIPAA Compliance Requirements**

### **Critical HIPAA Considerations**
- **Data Encryption**: All PHI must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Controls**: Implement role-based access with minimum necessary access
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all PHI access and modifications
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure data accuracy and prevent unauthorized modifications
- **Secure Communication**: Use HTTPS and secure APIs for all data transmission
- **Backup Security**: Secure backup procedures with encryption
- **Incident Response**: Plan for security incidents and data breaches

### **HIPAA Implementation Checklist**
- [ ] All PHI fields are properly encrypted
- [ ] Access controls limit PHI access to authorized personnel only
- [ ] Audit logs capture all PHI access and modifications
- [ ] Data validation prevents unauthorized data entry
- [ ] Secure authentication and session management
- [ ] Proper error handling that doesn't expose PHI
- [ ] Secure API endpoints with proper authentication
- [ ] Database security with RLS policies
- [ ] Logging and monitoring for security events
