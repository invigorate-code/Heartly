# Affidavit Regarding Client/Resident Cash Resources Analysis

## 1. Form Identification & Metadata
- Canonical title (normalized): Affidavit Regarding Client/Resident Cash Resources
- Printed form code / number: LIC 400
- Revision / version date: Not Visible
- Page count: 1
- Intended setting / regulatory context: Community care facilities licensed by the California Department of Social Services, Community Care Licensing Division, including Community Care Facilities (CCFs), Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly (RCFEs), and Residential Care Facilities for the Chronically Ill (RCF-CIs). Used to certify compliance with statutory bonding requirements for handling client/resident cash resources under California Health and Safety Code Sections 1560, 1568.021, and 1569.60 (Inferred from form content and statutory references).

## 2. Primary Purpose (1â€“3 sentences)
This form certifies whether a licensed facility needs a surety bond for handling client/resident cash resources and, if so, the required bond amount based on monthly cash handled. It ensures facilities comply with state laws by declaring the maximum cash managed and committing to safeguards and record-keeping. The affidavit is required for new applications, license renewals, or when reevaluating bonding needs.

## 3. Secondary / Embedded Objectives
- Declare the number of clients/residents in categories (children, adults, elderly) to assess bonding applicability.
- Specify if cash resources are handled and the maximum monthly amount.
- Calculate and state the required bond amount using the provided table.
- Certify ongoing compliance, including submitting new affidavits/bonds if cash handling increases.
- Affirm maintenance of safeguards and accurate records per regulations.
- Declare under penalty of perjury, with signatures for accountability.

## 6. Regulatory & Privacy Notes
- HIPAA direct identifiers found (mapped to 18 categories):
  None (no personal health info; form is administrative/financial for facilities).
- High-sensitivity subsets: None (financial bonding; no clinical data).
- Third-party identifiers: None.
- Free-text leakage risks: None (no free-text fields).

## 7. Normalization / Proposed Schema (Conceptual)
- Proposed tables (core + reference) with purpose:
  - `licensees`: Core for applicant/licensee info (purpose: signers).
  - `facilities`: Reference for facility details (purpose: location/bonding).
  - `affidavits`: Core transactional for affidavit (purpose: certification/bond).
- Relationships (text narrative): `affidavits` 1:1 with `licensees` and `facilities`.
- Indicate surrogate vs natural keys: Surrogate UUID PKs; license_number natural unique.

## 9. Row-Level Security (RLS) Strategy & Sample Policies
- Assume roles: `subscriber_owner`, `administrator`, `direct_support_staff`, `read_only_auditor`, `system_service`.
- Assume session context via `current_setting('app.tenant_id', true)` and `current_setting('app.role', true)` (or JWT claims).
- Show enabling RLS per table: `ALTER TABLE licensees ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; ALTER TABLE facilities ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; ALTER TABLE affidavits ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`
- Provide `CREATE POLICY` examples for: patients (or clients), medications, risk_assessments, notes/narratives.
  - For clients: Not Applicable (no clients; licensees/facilities).
  - For medications: Not Applicable.
  - For risk_assessments: Not Applicable.
  - For notes/narratives: Not Applicable (no narratives).
- Enforce: tenant isolation (`tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid`), role-based access, exclude soft-deleted rows (`deleted_at IS NULL`).
- Include an example masking approach (view or column expression) for highly sensitive columns (e.g., ssn, communicable_conditions): No high-sensitive like SSN; for signature:
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW masked_affidavits AS
  SELECT id, tenant_id, licensee_id, facility_id,
         CASE WHEN current_setting('app.role') = 'read_only_auditor' THEN 'REDACTED' ELSE signature END AS signature
  FROM affidavits WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
  ```
- Recommend supporting indexes for RLS performance (tenant + PK, partial indexes): `CREATE INDEX idx_affidavits_active ON affidavits (tenant_id) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;`
- Include an auditing trigger suggestion (outline function stub):
  ```sql
  CREATE FUNCTION audit_affidavit() RETURNS trigger AS $$
  BEGIN
    INSERT INTO audit_logs (table_name, operation, row_id, role, tenant_id)
    VALUES (TG_TABLE_NAME, TG_OP, NEW.id, current_setting('app.role'), current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid);
    RETURN NEW;
  END;
  $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

  CREATE TRIGGER affidavit_audit
  AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON affidavits
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION audit_affidavit();
  ```

## 10. Data Quality & Validation Rules
- Field formats, enumerations, required combinations, temporal logic (e.g., start_date <= end_date), dependency rules.
  - Formats: Numbers for client counts/bond/cash; Date (YYYY-MM-DD).
  - Enumerations: None.
  - Required combinations: If cash handled, require max amount/bond; Signature/date required.
  - Temporal logic: Date = submission; effective_start <= end.
  - Dependency rules: Bond amount from table based on max cash; If no cash, no bond.

## 11. De-Identification Strategy
- **Safe Harbor:** explicit fields to suppress or generalize.
  - Suppress: Licensee Name, Signature.
  - Generalize: Date to year; Cash/Bond to ranges.
- **Expert Determination:** quasi-identifiers set, generalization/bucketing, tokenization, k-anonymity & l-diversity targets.
  - Quasi-identifiers: Facility City/County, Client Counts.
  - Generalization/bucketing: Counts (0-10, 11+); Cash (buckets per table).
  - Tokenization: Pseudonym names.
  - k-anonymity & l-diversity targets: k=5; l=2.
- Transformation table (Original â†’ De-ID Rule â†’ Example Output).
  | Original | De-ID Rule | Example Output |
  |----------|------------|----------------|
  | Licensee Name | Tokenize | LICENSEE_001 |
  | Signature | Suppress | [REDACTED] |
  | Date | Generalize | 2025 |
  | Max Cash Monthly | Bucket | 751-1500 |
  | Bond Needed | Bucket | 2000 |
- Handling of free-text (NLP scrubbing, manual QA): Not Applicable.

## 12. Access Control & Security Controls
- Role vs Domain permission matrix.
  | Role / Domain | Identifiers | Financial | Signatures |
  |---------------|-------------|-----------|------------|
  | subscriber_owner | R/W | R/W | R/W |
  | administrator | R/W | R/W | R/W |
  | direct_support_staff | R | R | R |
  | read_only_auditor | R (masked) | R | R (masked) |
  | system_service | R/W | R/W | R/W |
- Mask/unmask workflow & audit events: Mask signatures; audit submissions.
- Encryption guidance: at-rest (column vs tablespace), in-transit, key management, potential field-level encryption candidates.
  - At-rest: Column for financial amounts.
  - In-transit: TLS.
  - Key management: Rotate.
  - Field-level: Signature, Cash amounts.
- Logging & anomaly detection recommendations: Log affidavit submissions; detect bond changes.

## 13. Implementation Backlog (Actionable Tickets)
- **P1 (must)**
  - DDL for affidavits; acceptance: Calculates bond from cash.
  - RLS enable; acceptance: Controls.
  - Validate bond table; acceptance: Matches amounts.
- **P2 (should)**
  - Masked views; acceptance: Redacts signatures.
  - De-ID script; acceptance: Buckets cash.
- **P3 (could)**
  - JSON exports; acceptance: Matches.
  - Auto-bond calculator; acceptance: Computes.

## 14. Open Questions / Assumptions
- Assumptions: Form for all CCF/RCFE/RCF-CI; client counts for bonding calculation.
- Uncertainties: If children/adults/elderly overlap; exact revision.
