# Admission Agreement Guide for Residential Facilities Analysis

## 1. Form Identification & Metadata
- Canonical title (normalized): Admission Agreement Guide for Residential Facilities
- Printed form code / number: Not Applicable
- Revision / version date: Not Visible
- Page count: 2
- Intended setting / regulatory context: Community care facilities licensed by the California Department of Social Services, pursuant to Title 22, Division 6 of the California Code of Regulations. Provided as a sample template for licensees to develop written admission agreements between the facility and clients/residents or their representatives (Inferred from instructions and regulatory references).

## 2. Primary Purpose (1–3 sentences)
This document serves as a guide for creating admission agreements in residential care facilities, outlining required elements such as facility information, services, rates, eviction procedures, and client obligations. It ensures compliance with state regulations by providing a template that details the terms of residency, payments, and rights. Note that it explicitly states it is not to be used as an actual admission agreement.

## 3. Secondary / Embedded Objectives
- Specify facility details and client identifiers for clear identification.
- Define basic and optional services, including rates and payment schedules.
- Outline eviction and discharge procedures, including notice requirements and reasons.
- Detail policies on rate changes, refunds, temporary absences, property responsibility, and visiting.
- Include client/resident obligations for cooperation and compliance.
- Reference regulatory rights for inspections and funding sources.
- Require signatures from parties to formalize agreement.

## 6. Regulatory & Privacy Notes
- HIPAA direct identifiers found (mapped to 18 categories):
  1. Names: Name of Client/Resident, Authorized Representative.
  2. Dates: Birthdate, Date discharged.
  3. Social Security numbers: Social Security No. (optional).
  4. Telephone numbers: Telephone (facility).
  5. Addresses: Address, City, State, Zip Code (facility).
  No other categories like medical records or biometrics.
- High-sensitivity subsets: Medication assistance (implies health conditions), bedside care (illnesses), supervision (behavioral needs), special diets (preferences/health).
- Third-party identifiers: Authorized Representative, family/agency for notification.
- Free-text leakage risks: General policies, visiting policy, refund policy, discharge reasons could include sensitive details; obligations mention medications/foods without administrator knowledge.

## 7. Normalization / Proposed Schema (Conceptual)
- Proposed tables (core + reference) with purpose:
  - `facilities`: Reference for facility details (purpose: reusable info).
  - `clients`: Core for resident demographics (purpose: unique profiles).
  - `admission_agreements`: Core transactional for agreement metadata, rates, policies (purpose: per admission).
  - `optional_services`: Reference for repeating table (purpose: itemized extras).
  - `signatures`: Reference for parties (purpose: audit consents).
- Relationships (text narrative): `admission_agreements` 1:1 with `clients` and `facilities`; `optional_services` 1:M with `admission_agreements`; `signatures` 1:M with `admission_agreements`. Use effective_start/end for agreement periods.
- Indicate surrogate vs natural keys: Surrogate UUID PKs; natural like SSN (unique index, optional).

Example JSON for primary entity (client):
```json
{
  "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "tenant_id": "987f6543-21ab-43cd-8765-432109876543",
  "name": "Doe, John",
  "ssn": "123-45-6789",
  "birthdate": "1950-01-01"
}
```

Example JSON for transactional entity (admission_agreement):
```json
{
  "id": "abcdef12-3456-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "client_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "basic_rate": 1500.00,
  "payment_timing": "in advance",
  "eviction_policies": "Nonpayment, etc."
}
```

## 9. Row-Level Security (RLS) Strategy & Sample Policies
- Assume roles: `subscriber_owner`, `administrator`, `direct_support_staff`, `read_only_auditor`, `system_service`.
- Assume session context via `current_setting('app.tenant_id', true)` and `current_setting('app.role', true)` (or JWT claims).
- Show enabling RLS per table: `ALTER TABLE facilities ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; ALTER TABLE clients ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; ALTER TABLE admission_agreements ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; ALTER TABLE optional_services ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; ALTER TABLE signatures ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`
- Provide `CREATE POLICY` examples for: patients (or clients), medications, risk_assessments, notes/narratives.
  - For clients (patients equivalent):
    ```sql
    CREATE POLICY clients_policy ON clients
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid AND deleted_at IS NULL)
    WITH CHECK (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid);
    ```
  - For medications: Not Applicable (no explicit meds table; map to assistance in agreement if detailed).
  - For risk_assessments (map to supervision in agreement):
    ```sql
    CREATE POLICY risk_policy ON admission_agreements
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid AND deleted_at IS NULL AND
           current_setting('app.role') IN ('subscriber_owner', 'administrator', 'direct_support_staff', 'system_service'))
    WITH CHECK (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid);
    ```
  - For notes/narratives (map to policies/refund in agreement):
    ```sql
    CREATE POLICY narratives_policy ON admission_agreements
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid AND deleted_at IS NULL AND
           (current_setting('app.role') IN ('subscriber_owner', 'administrator', 'direct_support_staff', 'system_service') OR
            (current_setting('app.role') = 'read_only_auditor' AND general_policies IS NULL)))
    WITH CHECK (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid);
    ```
- Enforce: tenant isolation (`tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid`), role-based access, exclude soft-deleted rows (`deleted_at IS NULL`).
- Include an example masking approach (view or column expression) for highly sensitive columns (e.g., ssn, communicable_conditions): For ssn:
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW masked_clients AS
  SELECT id, tenant_id, name, birthdate,
         CASE WHEN current_setting('app.role') = 'read_only_auditor' THEN 'REDACTED' ELSE ssn END AS ssn
  FROM clients WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
  ```
- Recommend supporting indexes for RLS performance (tenant + PK, partial indexes): `CREATE INDEX idx_admission_agreements_active ON admission_agreements (tenant_id, client_id) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;`
- Include an auditing trigger suggestion (outline function stub):
  ```sql
  CREATE FUNCTION audit_agreement() RETURNS trigger AS $$
  BEGIN
    INSERT INTO audit_logs (table_name, operation, old_data, new_data, role, tenant_id)
    VALUES (TG_TABLE_NAME, TG_OP, OLD, NEW, current_setting('app.role'), current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid);
    RETURN NEW;
  END;
  $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

  CREATE TRIGGER agreement_audit
  AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON admission_agreements
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION audit_agreement();
  ```

## 10. Data Quality & Validation Rules
- Field formats, enumerations, required combinations, temporal logic (e.g., start_date <= end_date), dependency rules.
  - Formats: Rates (numeric); Dates (YYYY-MM-DD); SSN (XXX-XX-XXXX optional).
  - Enumerations: Lodging (single/double room); Payment timing (in advance/arrears); Funding (private, SSI/SSP, government).
  - Required combinations: If optional services present, require table rows; Signatures required for all parties.
  - Temporal logic: Birthdate < effective_start; effective_start <= effective_end; Discharge date > effective_start.
  - Dependency rules: Total rate = basic + optional; Prorate if partial month; Funding source if government, apply 60-day notice.

## 11. De-Identification Strategy
- **Safe Harbor:** explicit fields to suppress or generalize.
  - Suppress: Name, SSN, Signatures, General policies (if sensitive).
  - Generalize: Birthdate to year; Address to state; Rates to ranges.
- **Expert Determination:** quasi-identifiers set, generalization/bucketing, tokenization, k-anonymity & l-diversity targets.
  - Quasi-identifiers: Birthdate, Lodging type, Funding source.
  - Generalization/bucketing: Age from birthdate (10-year); Rates (buckets like <1000, 1000-2000).
  - Tokenization: Pseudonym for names.
  - k-anonymity & l-diversity targets: k=5; l=3 for funding/behavioral.
- Transformation table (Original → De-ID Rule → Example Output).
  | Original | De-ID Rule | Example Output |
  |----------|------------|----------------|
  | Name | Tokenize | CLIENT_001 |
  | SSN | Suppress | [REDACTED] |
  | Birthdate | Generalize year | 1950 |
  | Basic rate | Bucket | 1000-2000 |
  | General policies | Suppress if sensitive | [REDACTED] |
- Handling of free-text (NLP scrubbing, manual QA): Scrub policies/refund for PHI; manual review attachments/duplicates.

## 12. Access Control & Security Controls
- Role vs Domain permission matrix.
  | Role / Domain | Demographics | Financial | Clinical/Medical | Legal/Authorizations | Narrative/Free-Text |
  |---------------|--------------|-----------|------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
  | subscriber_owner | R/W | R/W | R/W | R/W | R/W |
  | administrator | R/W | R/W | R/W | R/W | R/W |
  | direct_support_staff | R | R/W | R | R | R/W |
  | read_only_auditor | R (masked) | R | R (masked) | R | R (masked) |
  | system_service | R/W | R/W | R/W | R/W | R/W |
- Mask/unmask workflow & audit events: Views for masking SSN/policies; audit unmask with logs.
- Encryption guidance: at-rest (column vs tablespace), in-transit, key management, potential field-level encryption candidates.
  - At-rest: Column for SSN, names.
  - In-transit: TLS.
  - Key management: Rotate yearly.
  - Field-level: SSN, birthdate, policies.
- Logging & anomaly detection recommendations: Log rate changes/evictions; detect unusual accesses to financial.

## 13. Implementation Backlog (Actionable Tickets)
- **P1 (must)**
  - Implement schema with financial calculations; acceptance: Totals compute correctly.
  - Enable RLS/auditing; acceptance: Tenant isolation works.
  - Validate enums/dependencies; acceptance: Invalid data rejected.
- **P2 (should)**
  - Add masked views for PHI; acceptance: Auditors redacted.
  - Build de-ID functions; acceptance: Exports compliant.
  - Serialize to JSON; acceptance: Matches examples.
- **P3 (could)**
  - Partition for volume; acceptance: Historical queries faster.
  - Test eviction workflows; acceptance: Notices generated.

## 14. Open Questions / Assumptions
- Assumptions: OCR errors (e.g., "TEPHPOE" as Telephone, "SOCAL SECUTTY" as Social Security) corrected; template not filled, so placeholders analyzed.
- Uncertainties: Specific optional services; if attachments included in real use.
