## 6. Regulatory & Privacy Notes
- HIPAA direct identifiers found (mapped to 18 categories):
  1. Names: Client Name, Persons Notified Name, Admin Name.
  2. Dates: Date Occurred, Admission Date, Notified Date, Signature Date.
- High-sensitivity subsets: Type of Incident (death, suicide, aggression, rights violation), description/actions/comments (incident details, health/behavior).
- Third-party identifiers: Persons Notified, Administered By, By Whom.
- Free-text leakage risks: Description, Nature of Treatment, Immediate Action, Comments could include detailed PHI.

## 7. Normalization / Proposed Schema (Conceptual)
- Proposed tables (core + reference) with purpose:
  - `facilities`: Reference for facility info (purpose: address/name).
  - `clients`: Core for resident (purpose: demographics).
  - `incidents`: Core transactional for incident report (purpose: details/treatment/actions).
  - `incident_types`: Reference for checkboxes (purpose: categories).
  - `notifications`: Reference for notified persons (purpose: repeating table).
- Relationships (text narrative): `incidents` 1:1 with `facilities`; 1:M with `clients` (multiple clients); `incident_types` M:M with `incidents`; `notifications` 1:M with `incidents`.
- Indicate surrogate vs natural keys: Surrogate UUID PKs.

Example JSON for primary entity (client):
```json

```

## 9. Row-Level Security (RLS) Strategy & Sample Policies
- Assume roles: `subscriber_owner`, `administrator`, `direct_support_staff`, `read_only_auditor`, `system_service`.
- Assume session context via `current_setting('app.tenant_id', true)` and `current_setting('app.role', true)` (or JWT claims).
- Show enabling RLS per table: `ALTER TABLE facilities ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; ALTER TABLE clients ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; ALTER TABLE incidents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; ALTER TABLE incident_clients ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; ALTER TABLE incident_types ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; ALTER TABLE notifications ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`
- Provide `CREATE POLICY` examples for: patients (or clients), medications, risk_assessments, notes/narratives.
  - For clients (patients equivalent):
    ```sql
    CREATE POLICY clients_policy ON clients
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid AND deleted_at IS NULL)
    WITH CHECK (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid);
    ```
  - For medications: Not Applicable.
  - For risk_assessments (map to behavioral types in incident_types):
    ```sql
    CREATE POLICY risk_policy ON incident_types
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid AND deleted_at IS NULL AND
           (current_setting('app.role') IN ('subscriber_owner', 'administrator', 'direct_support_staff', 'system_service') OR
            type NOT IN ('Aggressive Act/Self', 'Aggressive Act/To Other', 'Aggressive Act/By Other', 'Suicide Attempt')))
    WITH CHECK (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid);
    ```
  - For notes/narratives (map to description in incidents):
    ```sql
    CREATE POLICY notes_policy ON incidents
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid AND deleted_at IS NULL AND
           (current_setting('app.role') IN ('subscriber_owner', 'administrator', 'direct_support_staff', 'system_service') OR
            description IS NULL))
    WITH CHECK (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid);
    ```
- Enforce: tenant isolation (`tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid`), role-based access, exclude soft-deleted rows (`deleted_at IS NULL`).
- Include an example masking approach (view or column expression) for highly sensitive columns (e.g., ssn, communicable_conditions): For description:
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW masked_incidents AS
  SELECT id, tenant_id, facility_id, occurred_date,
         CASE WHEN current_setting('app.role') = 'read_only_auditor' THEN 'REDACTED' ELSE description END AS description,
         -- Similar for other narratives
  FROM incidents WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
  ```
- Recommend supporting indexes for RLS performance (tenant + PK, partial indexes): `CREATE INDEX idx_incidents_active ON incidents (tenant_id) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;`
- Include an auditing trigger suggestion (outline function stub):
  ```sql
  CREATE FUNCTION audit_incident() RETURNS trigger AS $$
  BEGIN
    INSERT INTO audit_logs (table_name, operation, row_id, role, tenant_id)
    VALUES (TG_TABLE_NAME, TG_OP, NEW.id, current_setting('app.role'), current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid);
    RETURN NEW;
  END;
  $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

  CREATE TRIGGER incident_audit
  AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON incidents
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION audit_incident();
  ```

## 10. Data Quality & Validation Rules
- Field formats, enumerations, required combinations, temporal logic (e.g., start_date <= end_date), dependency rules.
  - Formats: Dates (YYYY-MM-DD); Ages (integer >0); Sex (M/F).
  - Enumerations: Type (checkboxes); Category (notified).
  - Required combinations: If medical treatment YES, require nature/where/by; At least one type checked.
  - Temporal logic: Occurred date <= signature date; Effective start <= end.
  - Dependency rules: If multiple clients, repeat rows; Notifications required for licensing etc.

## 11. De-Identification Strategy
- **Safe Harbor:** explicit fields to suppress or generalize.
  - Suppress: Client Name, Notified Name, Admin Name, Description, Treatment Nature, Action, Comments.
  - Generalize: Dates to month/year; Age to buckets.
- **Expert Determination:** quasi-identifiers set, generalization/bucketing, tokenization, k-anonymity & l-diversity targets.
  - Quasi-identifiers: Age, Sex, Admission Date.
  - Generalization/bucketing: Age (10-year); Date (month).
  - Tokenization: Pseudonym names.
  - k-anonymity & l-diversity targets: k=5; l=2 for incident types.
- Transformation table (Original â†’ De-ID Rule â†’ Example Output).
  | Original | De-ID Rule | Example Output |
  |----------|------------|----------------|
  | Client Name | Tokenize | CLIENT_001 |
  | Date Occurred | Generalize | 2025-07 |
  | Description | Suppress | [REDACTED] |
  | Age | Bucket | 70-79 |
  | Admin Name | Suppress | [REDACTED] |
- Handling of free-text (NLP scrubbing, manual QA): NLP for descriptions/comments (remove PHI); manual QA.

## 12. Access Control & Security Controls
- Role vs Domain permission matrix.
  | Role / Domain | Demographics | Clinical/Medical | Narrative/Free-Text | Signatures |
  |---------------|--------------|------------------|---------------------|------------|
  | subscriber_owner | R/W | R/W | R/W | R/W |
  | administrator | R/W | R/W | R/W | R/W |
  | direct_support_staff | R/W | R/W | R/W | R/W |
  | read_only_auditor | R (masked) | R (masked) | R (masked) | R |
  | system_service | R/W | R/W | R/W | R/W |

-- Strategy for enumerations: CHECK for incident_type, notified_type (fixed from form).
-- Optional partitioning note: Partition incident_reports by date_occurred range if high volume.
```

## 9. Row-Level Security (RLS) Strategy & Sample Policies
- Assume roles: `subscriber_owner`, `administrator`, `direct_support_staff`, `read_only_auditor`, `system_service`.
- Assume session context via `current_setting('app.tenant_id', true)` and `current_setting('app.role', true)` (or JWT claims).
- Show enabling RLS per table: `ALTER TABLE facilities ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; ALTER TABLE clients ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; ALTER TABLE incident_reports ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; ALTER TABLE involved_clients ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; ALTER TABLE notified_parties ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`
- Provide `CREATE POLICY` examples for: patients (or clients), medications, risk_assessments, notes/narratives.
  - For clients (patients equivalent):
    ```sql
    CREATE POLICY clients_policy ON clients
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid AND deleted_at IS NULL)
    WITH CHECK (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid);
    ```
  - For medications: Not Applicable.
  - For risk_assessments (map to incident_type for behavioral like abuse):
    ```sql
    CREATE POLICY risk_policy ON incident_reports
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid AND deleted_at IS NULL AND
           (current_setting('app.role') IN ('subscriber_owner', 'administrator', 'direct_support_staff', 'system_service') OR
            incident_type NOT IN ('Client/Resident Allegations of Abuse')))
    WITH CHECK (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid);
    ```
  - For notes/narratives (map to description in incident_reports):
    ```sql
    CREATE POLICY notes_policy ON incident_reports
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid AND deleted_at IS NULL AND
           (current_setting('app.role') IN ('subscriber_owner', 'administrator', 'direct_support_staff', 'system_service') OR
            description IS NULL))
    WITH CHECK (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid);
    ```
- Enforce: tenant isolation (`tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid`), role-based access, exclude soft-deleted rows (`deleted_at IS NULL`).
- Include an example masking approach (view or column expression) for highly sensitive columns (e.g., ssn, communicable_conditions): For description:
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW masked_incidents AS
  SELECT id, tenant_id, facility_id,
         CASE WHEN current_setting('app.role') = 'read_only_auditor' THEN 'REDACTED' ELSE description END AS description,
         -- Similar
  FROM incident_reports WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
  ```
- Recommend supporting indexes for RLS performance (tenant + PK, partial indexes): `CREATE INDEX idx_incident_reports_active ON incident_reports (tenant_id) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;`
- Include an auditing trigger suggestion (outline function stub):
  ```sql
  CREATE FUNCTION audit_incident() RETURNS trigger AS $$
  BEGIN
    INSERT INTO audit_logs (table_name, operation, row_id, role, tenant_id)
    VALUES (TG_TABLE_NAME, TG_OP, NEW.id, current_setting('app.role'), current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid);
    RETURN NEW;
  END;
  $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

  CREATE TRIGGER incident_audit
  AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON incident_reports
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION audit_incident();
  ```

## 10. Data Quality & Validation Rules
- Field formats, enumerations, required combinations, temporal logic (e.g., start_date <= end_date), dependency rules.
  - Formats: Dates (YYYY-MM-DD); Ages (integer); Phones (formatted).
  - Enumerations: Incident Type (Death/Injury/etc.); Notified (Police/etc.); Sex (M/F).
  - Required combinations: If treatment YES, require nature/where/by; Description required.
  - Temporal logic: Date Occurred <= Prep Date; Admission < Occurred; effective_start <= end.
  - Dependency rules: If Abuse, notify licensing; Multiple clients require repeating rows.

## 11. De-Identification Strategy
- **Safe Harbor:** explicit fields to suppress or generalize.
  - Suppress: Name, Description, Treatment Nature, Administrative Action.
  - Generalize: Dates to month/year; Age to buckets.
- **Expert Determination:** quasi-identifiers set, generalization/bucketing, tokenization, k-anonymity & l-diversity targets.
  - Quasi-identifiers: Age, Sex, Incident Type.
  - Generalization/bucketing: Age (10-year); Type (group e.g., injury/abuse/other).
  - Tokenization: Pseudonym name.
  - k-anonymity & l-diversity targets: k=5; l=2 for type.
- Transformation table (Original â†’ De-ID Rule â†’ Example Output).
  | Original | De-ID Rule | Example Output |
  |----------|------------|----------------|
  | Name | Tokenize | CLIENT_001 |
  | Date Occurred | Generalize | 2025-07 |
  | Description | Suppress | [REDACTED] |
  | Age | Bucket | 70-79 |
  | Treatment Nature | Suppress | [REDACTED] |
- Handling of free-text (NLP scrubbing, manual QA): NLP for descriptions; manual for sensitive.

## 12. Access Control & Security Controls
- Role vs Domain permission matrix.
  | Role / Domain | Demographics | Clinical/Medical | Narrative/Free-Text | Admin (Signatures)|
  |---------------|--------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
  | subscriber_owner | R/W | R/W | R/W | R/W |
  | administrator | R/W | R/W | R/W | R/W |
  | direct_support_staff | R/W | R/W | R/W | R/W |
  | read_only_auditor | R (masked) | R (masked) | R (masked) | R |
  | system_service | R/W | R/W | R/W | R/W |
- Mask/unmask workflow & audit events: Mask description/treatment; audit reports.
- Encryption guidance: at-rest (column vs tablespace), in-transit, key management, potential field-level encryption candidates.
  - At-rest: Column for description/treatment.
  - In-transit: TLS.
  - Key management: Rotate.
  - Field-level: Description, Treatment Nature.
- Logging & anomaly detection recommendations: Log incident submissions; detect patterns like frequent injuries.

## 13. Implementation Backlog (Actionable Tickets)
- **P1 (must)**
  - DDL for incidents/notifications; acceptance: Stores repeating.
  - RLS enable; acceptance: Isolation.
  - Validate enums; acceptance: Rejects invalid type.
- **P2 (should)**
  - Masked views; acceptance: Redacts description.
  - De-ID script; acceptance: Suppresses narratives.
  - Auditing; acceptance: Logs.
- **P3 (could)**
  - JSON exports; acceptance: Matches.
  - Partitioning; acceptance: Improves.

## 14. Open Questions / Assumptions
- Assumptions: OCR garbled but standard LIC 624 fields inferred; repeating for multiple clients/notified.
- Uncertainties: Exact checkboxes; if other types added.
