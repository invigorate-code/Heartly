This is another form, preplacement appraisal.

The query: "again but for this document and make sure it is in markdown"

They want the same analysis as before, for this new form.

The prompt is the same Single Form Master Analysis Prompt.

I need to analyze THIS SINGLE FORM ONLY, produce ONE standalone Markdown document with the sections.

Current date is July 24, 2025, but irrelevant.

Tools are available, but for this, since it's uploaded content, I can analyze directly, as "You can analyze content uploaded by user including images, pdfs, text files and more."

No need for tools.

Output the Markdown beginning with # <Canonical Form Name> Analysis

Canonical title: Preplacement Appraisal Information (from filename and content)

Form code: LIC 603

Revision: 6/22

Page count: 3

Intended: California Department of Social Services, for community care facilities, to assess applicant's suitability before placement.

Primary purpose: To gather information on the prospective resident's ambulatory status, functional capabilities, and services needed to determine if the facility can meet their needs.

Secondary: Check if they need skilled nursing, provide additional comments.

Field inventory:

Demographics: none explicit, but "this person" implies name elsewhere.

It's focused on capabilities.

Ambulatory: yes/no, with sub yes/no for walk without assistance, follow signals, use routes, evacuate quickly.

Functional: check yes/no for active no help, difficulty stairs, uses brace, feeble, uses walker (with sub unassisted), wheelchair (unassisted), grab bars, other describe.

Services needed: check yes/no for help transferring/dressing, bathing/hygiene, personal laundry/household (specify if capable), moving about, eating (devices/assistance), special diet/observation, toileting/assistance, continence/assistive, medication, special observation/night, managing cash, activity programs, special medical, incidental health, other.

Additional info: yes/no, attach sheet.

Statement: do not need skilled nursing care.

Signature, date.

So, mostly checkboxes with some free-text explain.

No repeating.

For missing: e.g., under medications, no details like name, but help with medication yes/no.

Recommend adding subfields.

## 6. Regulatory & Privacy Notes
- HIPAA direct identifiers found (mapped to 18 categories):
  1. Names: None explicit (but signature implies).
  2. Dates: Date Completed.
  No other direct categories (e.g., no DOB, SSN, addresses).
- High-sensitivity subsets: Behavioral risk (special observation for confusion/wandering, mental ability to follow signals), continence/toileting details, medication help, free-text descriptions (other functional/services, additional info) that may reveal disabilities or conditions.
- Third-party identifiers: None explicit (no representatives or providers named).
- Free-text leakage risks: "Other" descriptions, "specify" for laundry/tasks, additional information attachments could include unstructured PHI like specific conditions or incidents; recommend limiting to structured checkboxes or requiring redaction.

## 7. Normalization / Proposed Schema (Conceptual)
- Proposed tables (core + reference) with purpose:
  - `clients`: Core table for basic client reference (purpose: link to appraisal, though no demographics on form).
  - `preplacement_appraisals`: Core transactional table for overall appraisal data (purpose: store ambulatory, functional, services, statement).
  - `functional_capabilities`: Reference table for checkbox details (purpose: store yes/no responses for functional items).
  - `services_needed`: Reference table for service checkboxes (purpose: store yes/no and explanations).
- Relationships (text narrative): `preplacement_appraisals` 1:1 with `clients` (via client_id); `functional_capabilities` and `services_needed` 1:M with `preplacement_appraisals` (via appraisal_id, as multiple items per appraisal). Add effective_date for versioning.
- Indicate surrogate vs natural keys: Surrogate UUID PKs for all; no natural keys visible (e.g., no unique IDs on form).

Example JSON for primary entity (client):
```json
{
  "id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "tenant_id": "f1e2d3c4-b5a6-7890-fedc-ba0987654321",
  "appraisal_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
}
```

Example JSON for transactional entity (services_needed):
```json
{
  "id": "fedcba98-7654-3210-9876-543210fedcba",
  "appraisal_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",

## 9. Row-Level Security (RLS) Strategy & Sample Policies
- Assume roles: `subscriber_owner`, `administrator`, `direct_support_staff`, `read_only_auditor`, `system_service`.
- Assume session context via `current_setting('app.tenant_id', true)` and `current_setting('app.role', true)` (or JWT claims).
- Show enabling RLS per table: `ALTER TABLE clients ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; ALTER TABLE preplacement_appraisals ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; ALTER TABLE functional_capabilities ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; ALTER TABLE services_needed ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`
- Provide `CREATE POLICY` examples for: patients (or clients), medications, risk_assessments, notes/narratives.
  - For clients (patients equivalent):
    ```sql
    CREATE POLICY clients_policy ON clients
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid AND deleted_at IS NULL)
    WITH CHECK (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid);
    ```
  - For medications (map to help_medication in services_needed):
    ```sql
    CREATE POLICY medications_policy ON services_needed
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid AND deleted_at IS NULL AND
           (current_setting('app.role') IN ('subscriber_owner', 'administrator', 'direct_support_staff', 'system_service')))
    WITH CHECK (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid);
    ```
  - For risk_assessments (map to special_observation in services_needed for behavioral risks):
    ```sql
    CREATE POLICY risk_assessments_policy ON services_needed
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid AND deleted_at IS NULL AND
           (current_setting('app.role') IN ('subscriber_owner', 'administrator', 'direct_support_staff', 'system_service') OR
            (current_setting('app.role') = 'read_only_auditor' AND special_observation = false)))
    WITH CHECK (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid);
    ```
  - For notes/narratives (map to additional_comments in preplacement_appraisals):
    ```sql
    CREATE POLICY notes_policy ON preplacement_appraisals
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid AND deleted_at IS NULL AND
           (current_setting('app.role') IN ('subscriber_owner', 'administrator', 'direct_support_staff', 'system_service') OR
            (current_setting('app.role') = 'read_only_auditor' AND additional_comments IS NULL)))
    WITH CHECK (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid);
    ```
- Enforce: tenant isolation (`tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid`), role-based access, exclude soft-deleted rows (`deleted_at IS NULL`).
- Include an example masking approach (view or column expression) for highly sensitive columns (e.g., ssn, communicable_conditions): No SSN/communicable; for other_description (functional free-text):
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW masked_functional_capabilities AS
  SELECT id, tenant_id, appraisal_id,
         CASE WHEN current_setting('app.role') = 'read_only_auditor' THEN 'REDACTED' ELSE other_description END AS other_description,
         -- Other fields
  FROM functional_capabilities WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
  ```
- Recommend supporting indexes for RLS performance (tenant + PK, partial indexes): `CREATE INDEX idx_preplacement_appraisals_active ON preplacement_appraisals (tenant_id) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;`
- Include an auditing trigger suggestion (outline function stub):
  ```sql
  CREATE FUNCTION audit_func() RETURNS trigger AS $$
  BEGIN
    INSERT INTO audit_logs (table_name, operation, row_id, user_role, tenant_id, timestamp)
    VALUES (TG_TABLE_NAME, TG_OP, NEW.id, current_setting('app.role'), current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
    RETURN NEW;
  END;
  $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

  CREATE TRIGGER audit_preplacement
  AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON preplacement_appraisals
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION audit_func();
  ```

## 10. Data Quality & Validation Rules
- Field formats, enumerations, required combinations, temporal logic (e.g., start_date <= end_date), dependency rules.
  - Formats: Date Completed (YYYY-MM-DD); booleans for yes/no.
  - Enumerations: Ambulatory Status (Ambulatory, Nonambulatory); sub-unassisted (Yes, No).
  - Required combinations: If Uses walker/wheelchair = Yes, require sub unassisted; No Skilled Nursing = true for submission; Additional Info = Yes requires comments.
  - Temporal logic: Date Completed >= effective_start; effective_start <= effective_end.
  - Dependency rules: If Nonambulatory, flag for review (e.g., ensure evacuation abilities no); If special observation Yes, require explanation (app logic).

## 11. De-Identification Strategy
- **Safe Harbor:** explicit fields to suppress or generalize.
  - Suppress: Signature, Other description, Additional comments, laundry specify, other services.
  - Generalize: Date Completed to year; no ages/DOB on form.
- **Expert Determination:** quasi-identifiers set, generalization/bucketing, tokenization, k-anonymity & l-diversity targets.
  - Quasi-identifiers: Ambulatory Status, Uses wheelchair/walker, Special observation.
  - Generalization/bucketing: Group mobility (e.g., independent/assisted/dependent); bucket assistance needs (low/medium/high).
  - Tokenization: None (no names).
  - k-anonymity & l-diversity targets: k=5; l=2 for sensitive (e.g., behavioral observation).
- Transformation table (Original → De-ID Rule → Example Output).
  | Original | De-ID Rule | Example Output |
  |----------|------------|----------------|
  | Other description | Suppress | [REDACTED] |
  | Date Completed | Generalize to year | 2023 |
  | Special observation | Bucket | Behavioral need: Yes/No |
  | Additional comments | Suppress/NLP scrub | [REDACTED] |
  | Help medication | Keep (binary) | true |
- Handling of free-text (NLP scrubbing, manual QA): NLP to remove any embedded PHI (e.g., conditions); manual QA for attachments; generalize to categories (e.g., "mobility issue").

## 12. Access Control & Security Controls
- Role vs Domain permission matrix.
  | Role / Domain | Functional/ADLs | Clinical/Medical | Behavioral/Risk | Narrative/Free-Text | Signatures |
  |---------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|------------|
  | subscriber_owner | R/W | R/W | R/W | R/W | R/W |
  | administrator | R/W | R/W | R/W | R/W | R/W |
  | direct_support_staff | R/W | R | R/W | R/W | R |
  | read_only_auditor | R (masked) | R (masked) | R (masked) | R (masked) | R |

- Mask/unmask workflow & audit events: Role-based views for masking; log unmask actions with reason.
- Encryption guidance: at-rest (column vs tablespace), in-transit, key management, potential field-level encryption candidates.
  - At-rest: Column for free-text (other_description, additional_comments).
  - In-transit: TLS for all.
  - Key management: KMS with rotation.
  - Field-level: Behavioral fields (special_observation), narrative texts.
- Logging & anomaly detection recommendations: Log sensitive accesses; detect bulk reads on behavioral data.

## 13. Implementation Backlog (Actionable Tickets)
- **P1 (must)**
  - Implement DDL with booleans for checkboxes; acceptance: Schema deploys, inserts succeed.
  - Enable RLS for tenant/role isolation; acceptance: Tests show access controls.
  - Add auditing triggers; acceptance: Logs generated on changes.
- **P2 (should)**
  - Build masked views for free-text; acceptance: Auditors see redacted.
  - Validate dependencies (e.g., sub-fields); acceptance: Errors on invalid data.
  - Develop de-ID script for export; acceptance: Output suppresses narratives.
- **P3 (could)**
  - Add enum lookups if expanding; acceptance: Future-proof.
  - Generate JSON serializers; acceptance: Matches examples.

## 14. Open Questions / Assumptions
- Assumptions: Form completed by applicant/rep (from statement); no demographics (may be on separate form); OCR errors (e.g., "APPRAISAL" garbled) not affecting fields.
- Uncertainties: Exact page 1 content (headers/name?); if attachments digitized.
