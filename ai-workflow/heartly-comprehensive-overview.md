## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Architectural Decisions

### 1. Offline Strategy - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

**Decision**: Defer offline capabilities to Phase 2 (Post-MVP)

- **MVP**: Standard web application with full online functionality
- **Phase 2**: Add PWA capabilities with offline support
- **Rationale**: Faster MVP delivery, validate core functionality first
- **Implementation**: See `mvp-outline.md` for phased roadmap

### 2. Development Approach - CONFIRMED ‚úÖ

**Decision**: Single developer approach with consolidated responsibilities

- **Workflow**: See `implementation-guides/single-developer-workflow.md` for detailed approach
- **Quality**: Maintained through structured processes and automation
- **Timeline**: Adjusted for single developer capacity

### 3. MVP Scope - DEFINED ‚úÖ

**Decision**: Focus on core functionality without advanced features

- **MVP Features**: See `mvp-outline.md` for complete scope
- **Future Features**: Clearly separated in Post-MVP Roadmap
- **Rationale**: Deliver working system quickly, iterate based on feedback

### 4. Technology Stack - CONFIRMED ‚úÖ

**Decision**: Modern, proven technologies with strong community support

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **Backend**: NestJS with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TypeORM
- **Authentication**: SuperTokens
- **Details**: See `heartly-technical-structure.md`

## üîê Environment Strategy & PHI Protection

### Three-Tier Environment Architecture

#### 1. Development Environment
- **Purpose**: Active development and unit testing
- **Data**: Synthetic data only, NO real PHI
- **Access**: Developer only
- **Infrastructure**: Local Docker containers

#### 2. Staging Environment
- **Purpose**: Integration testing and user acceptance
- **Data**: Anonymized production-like data
- **Access**: Developer + selected testers
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud-based, production-like

#### 3. Production Environment
- **Purpose**: Live system with real PHI
- **Data**: Real patient data with full encryption
- **Access**: Authorized users only with audit logging
- **Infrastructure**: HIPAA-compliant cloud hosting

### PHI Protection Measures
- End-to-end encryption for all PHI
- Row-level security in database
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Regular security audits
- Automated compliance monitoring

## üéØ Executive Summary

Heartly is being developed as a HIPAA-compliant facility management system using a phased approach optimized for single developer implementation. The MVP (Months 1-3) delivers core functionality with basic features, establishing a solid foundation for future enhancements. 

Key decisions include deferring offline capabilities to Phase 2, focusing on essential features for MVP, and maintaining high quality through structured processes and automation. The system prioritizes compliance, usability, and reliability over advanced features in the initial release.

Success will be measured by delivering a functional, compliant system that can onboard real facilities while maintaining the flexibility to iterate based on user feedback. The phased approach ensures sustainable development pace while building toward the full vision outlined in our strategic documents.
