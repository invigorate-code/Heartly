## ⚠️ Critical Strategic Decisions Required (IMMEDIATE)



### 1. Offline Capability Decision (MUST DECIDE BY DAY 2)

**Current Gap:** Vision promises offline capabilities, but plan doesn't address this fundamental architectural requirement.



**Option A: Offline-First Architecture (Recommended if Critical)**

- Implement PWA with Service Workers from Phase 1

- Add IndexedDB for local data storage

- Build sync engine for conflict resolution

- **Impact:** +4-6 weeks to Phase 1, changes entire tech stack



**Option B: Defer Offline to Post-MVP**

- Build standard web application first

- Add offline capabilities in Phase 4

- **Impact:** Faster MVP, but may disappoint early adopters



**Decision Owner:** Product Owner + Technical Leads

**Decision Deadline:** Phase 0, Day 2



### 2. Workflow Transformation Scope

**Current Gap:** Vision promises conversational, engaging interfaces; plan delivers basic CRUD.



**Immediate Action Required:**

- Product Owner to identify 2-3 workflows for true transformation in MVP

- UX Lead to create detailed interaction designs

- Estimate additional 3-4 weeks for transformative UX vs basic CRUD

## 🔐 Environment Strategy & PHI Protection



### Three-Tier Environment Architecture (Plus Offline Considerations)

1. **Development Environment**

- Purpose: Active development and unit testing

- Data: Synthetic data only, NO real PHI

- Access: Development team only

- **NEW:** Offline simulation environment for PWA testing

- **NEW:** Sample import files for migration testing



2. **Staging/QA Environment**

- Purpose: Integration testing, UAT, compliance validation

- Data: Anonymized production-like data, NO real PHI

- **NEW:** Network throttling for offline scenario testing

- **NEW:** Full-scale data migration testing environment



3. **Production Environment**

- Purpose: Live system with real PHI

- Data: Real patient and facility data

- **NEW:** CDN integration for offline asset caching

- **NEW:** Immutable audit log storage (AWS QLDB or equivalent)



### Audit Log Immutability Strategy (NEW)

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Write-Only Database Permissions:** Application can INSERT but never UPDATE/DELETE audit records

- **Cryptographic Chain:** Each log entry includes SHA-256 hash of previous entry

- **Dedicated Storage:** Separate database/service for audit logs (e.g., AWS QLDB, Azure Immutable Storage)

- **Tamper Detection:** Daily integrity checks comparing hash chains

- **Legal Hold:** Automated 7-year retention with litigation hold capabilities

- **Export Format:** Cryptographically signed audit exports for compliance reviews



### Critical Environment Rules

- ⛔ **NEVER copy production data to lower environments without full anonymization**

- ⛔ **NEVER use real patient names, SSNs, or medical records in testing**

- ⛔ **NEVER allow audit log modifications, even by administrators**

- ✅ **ALWAYS use synthetic data generators for testing**

- ✅ **ALWAYS test offline scenarios with network disconnection**

- ✅ **ALWAYS verify audit log integrity daily**
