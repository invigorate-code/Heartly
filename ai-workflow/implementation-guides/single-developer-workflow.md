# Single Developer Workflow for Heartly

## Overview

This document outlines the consolidated workflow and responsibilities for developing Heartly as a single developer, maintaining high quality standards while efficiently managing all aspects of the project.

## Consolidated Role Responsibilities

As a single developer, you'll need to wear multiple hats while maintaining the same quality standards. Here's how to consolidate the core team responsibilities:

### Primary Responsibilities (Daily Focus)

1. **Technical Development (40% of time)**
   - Backend API development (NestJS)
   - Frontend development (Next.js)
   - Database design and migrations
   - Authentication system (SuperTokens)
   - API integration and testing

2. **Security & Compliance (25% of time)**
   - HIPAA compliance implementation
   - Audit logging and data protection
   - Security best practices
   - Privacy controls and access management

3. **User Experience & Design (20% of time)**
   - UI/UX design and implementation
   - Workflow optimization
   - Accessibility compliance
   - User feedback integration

4. **Quality Assurance (15% of time)**
   - Testing strategy and implementation
   - Bug fixes and maintenance
   - Performance optimization
   - Documentation

## Simplified Workflow Definition of Ready

For each feature, ensure you have:

- ✅ **Technical Feasibility Check**: Architecture review and technical planning
- ✅ **Compliance Review**: HIPAA requirements and audit trail planning
- ✅ **UX Design**: Wireframes or mockups (even simple ones)
- ✅ **Test Plan**: Basic acceptance criteria and testing approach
- ✅ **Documentation Plan**: What needs to be documented for users/developers

## Development Priorities for Single Developer

### 1. Core Infrastructure First
   - Database schema and migrations
   - Authentication system
   - Basic CRUD operations
   - Audit logging framework

### 2. Essential Features
   - Client management
   - Facility management
   - Basic reporting
   - PDF generation

### 3. Advanced Features (Post-MVP)
   - Complex workflows
   - Advanced reporting
   - Integration features
   - Performance optimizations

## Daily Workflow Recommendations

### Morning Routine (30 min)
1. Review previous day's progress
2. Check any error logs or issues
3. Plan day's tasks using TodoWrite
4. Update project status

### Development Blocks (2-3 hour chunks)
1. Focus on single feature/component
2. Write tests alongside code
3. Document as you go
4. Commit frequently with clear messages

### End of Day (30 min)
1. Review completed work
2. Run tests to ensure nothing broken
3. Document next steps
4. Update todo list for tomorrow

## Time Management Tips

### Weekly Schedule
- **Monday**: Planning and architecture decisions
- **Tuesday-Thursday**: Core development work
- **Friday**: Testing, documentation, and cleanup

### Feature Development Cycle
1. **Day 1**: Design and planning
2. **Day 2-3**: Implementation
3. **Day 4**: Testing and refinement
4. **Day 5**: Documentation and deployment prep

## Quality Maintenance Strategies

### Without a Full Team
1. **Automated Testing**: Invest time in comprehensive test suites
2. **Linting & Formatting**: Use tools to maintain code quality
3. **Code Reviews**: Review your own code after breaks
4. **Documentation**: Document decisions and complex logic immediately
5. **Regular Refactoring**: Schedule time for code cleanup

### HIPAA Compliance Checks
- Review each feature for PHI handling
- Ensure audit logging is comprehensive
- Validate access controls
- Test error handling doesn't expose sensitive data

## Risk Mitigation

### Single Point of Failure
1. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Everything should be documented
2. **Version Control**: Commit frequently with detailed messages
3. **Backup Strategy**: Regular backups of code and data
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Keep documentation updated for potential handoff

### Avoiding Burnout
1. **Realistic Timelines**: Add buffer time to estimates
2. **Regular Breaks**: Follow pomodoro or similar technique
3. **Scope Management**: Resist feature creep
4. **Celebrate Wins**: Acknowledge completed milestones

## Tools & Automation

### Essential Development Tools
- **VS Code**: Primary IDE with extensions
- **GitHub Copilot/Claude**: AI pair programming
- **Docker**: Consistent development environment
- **Postman/Insomnia**: API testing
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation

### Productivity Enhancers
- **Todo Management**: Use TodoWrite extensively
- **Time Tracking**: Monitor where time is spent
- **Automated Testing**: Jest, Cypress for confidence
- **Code Generation**: Use CLI tools and snippets

## Success Metrics

### Weekly Goals
- Complete 2-3 features or user stories
- Maintain 80% test coverage
- Zero critical bugs in production
- Documentation kept current

### Monthly Milestones
- Deliver functional increment
- User feedback incorporated
- Technical debt addressed
- Security audit completed

## Getting Help

### When Stuck
1. Review existing documentation and code
2. Use AI assistants for problem-solving
3. Check community forums and Stack Overflow
4. Consider scheduling consultation if needed

### Resources
- **Technical**: NestJS and Next.js documentation
- **Compliance**: HIPAA compliance guides in `ai-workflow/hipaa-compliance-guide/`
- **Architecture**: Review `heartly-technical-structure.md`
- **Features**: Refer to `mvp-outline.md` for scope

Remember: As a single developer, your time is the most valuable resource. Focus on delivering core functionality well rather than trying to build everything at once. The phased approach in the MVP outline is designed to support sustainable development pace.
