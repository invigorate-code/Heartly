# Docker Integration for CI/CD and Testing

## Date: 2025-08-07

### What was implemented:
1. **Created docker-compose.test.yml**
   - Dedicated test environment configuration
   - PostgreSQL for main database
   - PostgreSQL for SuperTokens
   - Redis for caching/sessions
   - SuperTokens for authentication
   - All services with health checks

2. **Updated GitHub Actions CI**
   - Now uses Docker Compose for all required services
   - Proper health checks and waiting logic
   - Database migrations run before tests
   - Complete environment variables including Redis and Mail config
   - Cleanup after tests complete

3. **Created Test Helper Scripts**
   - `start-test-env.sh` - Starts all Docker services for testing
   - `stop-test-env.sh` - Stops and cleans up Docker services
   - `run-tests-with-docker.sh` - Complete test runner with Docker

4. **Updated package.json Scripts**
   - `test:with-docker` - Run backend tests with Docker environment
   - `test:all` - Run all tests including frontend
   - `test:env:start` - Start test Docker environment
   - `test:env:stop` - Stop test Docker environment

### Docker Services Configuration:
- **PostgreSQL (Main)**: Port 5432 - Main application database
- **PostgreSQL (SuperTokens)**: Port 5433 - Authentication database
- **Redis**: Port 6379 - Caching and session storage
- **SuperTokens**: Port 3567 - Authentication service

### CI Pipeline Flow:
1. Start Docker Compose services
2. Wait for all services to be healthy
3. Run database migrations
4. Execute backend tests
5. Execute e2e tests
6. Clean up Docker services

### Local Development Usage:
```bash
# Start test environment
pnpm run test:env:start

# Run tests with Docker
pnpm run test:with-docker

# Run all tests (backend + frontend)
pnpm run test:all

# Stop test environment
pnpm run test:env:stop
```

### Benefits:
- Consistent test environment across local and CI
- All required services properly configured
- Automatic cleanup after tests
- Health checks ensure services are ready
- Isolated test network for security

### Next Steps:
- Add integration tests that leverage all services
- Consider adding Elasticsearch or other services if needed
- Add test data seeding scripts
- Implement parallel test execution
- Add test coverage reporting with Docker
