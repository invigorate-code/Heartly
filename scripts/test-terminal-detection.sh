echo "=== Terminal Detection Test ==="
echo ""

# Test different terminal types
echo "1. Testing with xterm-256color (full color):"
TERM=xterm-256color DEBUG_COLORS=true ./scripts/dev-progress.sh | head -10
echo ""

echo "2. Testing with xterm (basic color):"
TERM=xterm DEBUG_COLORS=true ./scripts/dev-progress.sh | head -10
echo ""

echo "3. Testing with dumb terminal (no color):"
TERM=dumb DEBUG_COLORS=true ./scripts/dev-progress.sh | head -10
echo ""

echo "4. Testing with unknown terminal:"
TERM=unknown DEBUG_COLORS=true ./scripts/dev-progress.sh | head -10
echo ""

echo "=== Color Mode Summary ==="
echo "Full Color (8+ colors): Uses full ANSI color codes"
echo "Basic Color (2-7 colors): Uses bright color variants"
echo "No Color (0-1 colors): No color codes, plain text"
echo ""

echo "=== How to Use ==="
echo "Normal usage: ./scripts/dev-progress.sh"
echo "Debug mode: DEBUG_COLORS=true ./scripts/dev-progress.sh"
echo "Force terminal type: TERM=xterm ./scripts/dev-progress.sh"
echo ""

echo "=== Best Practices ==="
echo "✅ Use pre-push hook for best experience: .git/hooks/pre-push"
echo "✅ Script auto-detects terminal capabilities"
echo "✅ Works on any terminal (color or no color)"
echo "✅ Progress bars work regardless of color support"
